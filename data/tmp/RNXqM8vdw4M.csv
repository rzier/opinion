Atleast keep unnecessary words away from the conversation. For someone who is so experienced  like Ranveer, I expect him to put an effort to match the language and jargons and frequency with the guests. The guest should speak in his way. Ranveer should accommodate.  And given that how open minded is Ranveer, he should care lesser about political corectness. It increases the amount of unneccessary words which the guests and the viewers have to process.  Also now at this age and after having so much worldly experience,  Ranveer won't get his curiosity satisfied by people but if he himself goes on a quest himself, asks himself, and meditates on his doubts. Ask only those question that will help other humans in their growth, not boost their ego. Thanks.",1,0

19,2023-12-01T13:44:57Z,@WiShFuLDiVA,"Bharat has been way too kind with other religions despite having the highest major population of Hindus. As much as it is necessary to be kind and hospitable and what not, we also need to understand what makes a particular religion exclusive - and that includes a clear understanding of both the insiders and the outsiders. Insiders can be considered as the original natives of a particular nation (which shouldn't include people who later claim to be natives when the situations seem favourable for their selfish needs). Outsiders can be considered as anyone who chose to walk out of Bharat during partition, who absolutely don't deserve to come back to Bharat in any shape or form. This idea needs to be clear in every Hindu's mind. Sanatan Dharm has been here before any other religions that ceased to exist later and attempted to claim superiority over Hinduism. Bharat will regain its power and influence all around the globe from every aspect possible. Accept it, or deny it - it is approaching and no one can stop it. Jai Bharat. Om Namah Shivaay. Jai Maa Kali. ",1,0

I am here to clarify the things based on \"" facts \"" as how jsd wants the conversation . The people of this country ...the vast majority of educated masses distrust the government because of the below reasons ..which nobody will bring to discussion as these are \"" Inconvenient Truths \""  1) the ruling party talks about democracy but simultaneously downgrades all the independent institutions in India . The CBI is not given autonomy and 95 percent of cases are against opposition party people only .. (the man on the street knows how much corruption is there on the ground presently )  The Election Commissioner post which is on par to SC judje is now being downgraded .So the BJP doesn't want a fair and independent CEC . That speaks volumes about what is going to happen during election. The SC collegium system being attacked daily .( Though the ruling party itself doesn't have any qualms about corrupt members in its midst )  Point 2 ) On the economic development maximum gains going to select corporate houses with the rest of people of nation fighting for scraps leftover . Point 3 ) We belong to 500 princely States which came under a single Union called India on the promise of equality in governance i.e . Called as \""FEDERALISM\"" . By attacking Federalism and laughing at the states govts ..the union govt is indirectly laughing at the people themselves . The elected state govt   in Kerala State can govern itself without advice from Delhi for subjects in State list . By trampling federalism the govt is indirectly trampling the concept of local self governance enshrined in the constitution.           This and several cases left uninvestigated ...what happened to the 15 lakh crore black money . How much shell companies in Mauritius did u catch or prosecute ??           All these and several thousand similar unanswered questions are what make educated people to distrust . ...

Why cant we speak about the bribery culture and cultural/caste/religious indifferences which are making people feel bad, but what to make out from such scenarios in reality from a law and order perspective or just simply as an Indian interested to know whats going on? CAA was definitely a detailed conversation which we came to learn, but would still want some real problems to be addressed or questioned or talked about. Not to pass any judgements but to know whats the real issue and the facts right ? Is it not ok to speak about such things even when its an ongoing National crisis or atrocities across land pooling, or development which comes as a trade-off along with such things that we dont want to touch such topics? Or it may lodge a heavy troll or criticism in general about opinion speaking and facts check? But truly was a nice and brilliant conversation.  Yes, ofcourse were ready to be part of the journey for most of the NRIs and lack of a clear path or understanding of potentials to startup a new business in India or make a living by doing a job or maybe its just we just dont want to risk our families at the cost of adding voice into Indias development- But we certainly stand by a progressive and prosperous Bharat!",0,0

A PM who can answer the toughest question in a press conference like Dr. S. Jaishankar Sir or A strong person who delivers like Nitin Gadkari Sir or if from Congress it can be Shashi Tharoor Sir. All we want is a PM who is answerable to the voters not like NAMO ji whose just does mann ki baat, dresses nicely, poses nicely infront of camera team and just adress rallies to with a soul purpose of winning elections on his face.   We need to wake up and give chances to the most deserving Minister's who have delivered and have done all the hard work.   Just as a educated citizen of the country we know how PR agencies are working endless behind Modiji & Rahul Gandhi to brush up their charm but sad reality is that ki those who deserve don't even get a chance in this country.   Hope we wake up early and start a new politics based on delivery rather than worrying about the election throughout the year.   My suggestion is to conduct a US kind of presidential election where the PM candidate have to win debates and prove why he is the right choice.  And one more point I would like to add is to conduct one election which makes a stable government for 5 years that means no tussele between state and centre just pure work without any hiccups or revenge seeking strategies between centre and state for the smooth and speedy development of our INDIA.",0,0

You guys have never imagined how many such cases are being pending in our court??? It's a serious issue nobody wants to talk about. After the accident many of the family may completely sink into debts/ financial crisis as part of hospital treatment and other expediture for particular period of time.. It's really sad that noone raise their voice for our rights!!!   post motor accident, we all deserve to be settled for an insurance claim amount within at least 6 or 12 months from the accident date ???Do you agree!!!! It's yet to be implemented!?  If I delayed paying car / bike insurance I would be charged fine by police/ court immediately!!! But post accident of severe injury we have to wait nearly 5 years for our claim amount from the time of accident occurred!!! Is that a fair deal?What kind of justice is this?? Deleyed settlement is it because of our court Or insurance company?? When I find the pending list and time taking for settling a claim in our court I really feel sad.. Because our turn around time is so desperate for a citizen... We should respect each of our time!!!Delayed justice is as equal as a crime???  This is not against anyone. But, I'm thinking why we need social system? It's for making our life easy right? Assure justice to anyone right?  So i would say Drive carefully for your own good!!! It's a request! Pls understand this is not only my concern an entire human may face this issue... Irrespective of the rich, poor, religion, politics etc....",0,0

I include the Bhojpuri belt into UP.   These Biharis have produced  world famous intellectuals e.g. V S Naipaul- Nobel Prize Winner;  soldiers;  sportsmen e.g. Kanhai;  politicians e.g. Cheddi Jagan and at the moment the Presidents of Guyana (new oil rich) and Suriname are of Bhojpuri origin. Or the longest surving Secretary General of the Commowealth - Sir Shridath Ramphal  Or  former judge of the World Court -  shabudeen  They have also preserved Indian culture  and there are hundreds of mandirs and masjids in Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam.  Being Hindu or Muslim are alternate ways of being the same thing.and they are one community.  The same trends are in Mauritius and Fiji.   Bihar used to be  a seminal area of Indian culture -  the Universities.  Free Biharis and stop the oppression and they will restore India to its ancient greatness as a world civilization.   Indian publicists and historians need to learn more of these people who are not NRI's.",0,0

Personally, I think the question should not be phrased the way it is, especially when this is a public forum. All citizens are entitled to their opinions and criticisms while I agree, they have done more harm than benefit by tweaking facts/history to suit their narratives. With that said, the question should've been asked differently.  I am not sure if you would read this comment but wanted to make a note. This is just my opinion.",0,1

Let me focus on the point related to a north east state you mentioned. The issue about Vajpayee's ashes @ 32:30  Firstly, 99% of Nagas didn't even gave a damn about this. Only activists and politically motivated people cared. Secondly, the next day the general public allowed the ashes to be immersed, because like i said, they don't care about this political drama. Thirdly, The people who were against the immersion of ashes were the Congress party workers (for obvious reasons) and a ONE church group. And yet you chose to generalize the entire community .. Fourthly, you have to understand the political climate at the time. It was a very sensitive time (August 2018) Just days before that, student bodies all across Nagaland were protesting against BJP and shouting anti-BJP slogans due to CAA and other Hindutva related issues. That's like removing food stamps for black people during BLM riots. Wrong policy, Wrong place, Wrong time. Finally, when did we north-east Christians ever celebrate the death of a mafia don? Strawman argument ka baap hai ye.   People like Sai Deepak only want to outcast and exclude minorities. Anyone who does not follow his faith and culture is an enemy to him.  Jaisa party waisa soch. All tatti people think alike and act alike. This is why no one in the north east will ever ever support people like you. We don't care how much BJP , RSS and other Sanghis hates us, you cannot get rid of us, change our culture, change our religion, or take away our constitutional rights. We are Indians and will remain part of Indian forever. Learn to suck it up and tolerate our existence. Podcast wodcast karne se kuch naghi hoga. All it does is make us aware of your vile and dangerous ideologies and why we should never support BJP type people. Jai Hind!",0,1

Then all us subscribers can follow it and bring back the golden Vedic age. Only no-nutters in India can lead the country. I think an amendment has to be passed. No-Nutters have the right to dictate since they have the ability to control themselves and not fall prey to honey-trap like Nehru.

Intellectualism isn't just about being well read or citing arbitrary sources to somehow support your argument but it's about being reflective about fundamental ethical questions inherent in your arguments themselves. It is about being cautious about material implications of your arguments. All his jugglery does is provides some form of knowledge legitimacy to the hate-filled whatapp forwards that is being spread on social media as well as existing prejudices that already existed within Indian societies. There is no additional insight but only various attempts to justify them through selective reading of texts.  Everything can't be reduced to our religious identity and it is important to be empathetic to our fellow humans because we never choose where we are born and it is a random event. We have multiple identities some we are born with which we can't choose and some we earn through our actions and interests. This is not decoloniality in action but deviousness in action.",3,3

1610,2023-07-07T19:11:19Z,@aBrokenShard,"Although I really enjoyed the conversation, I just felt that this man had a lot more to share and in some ways the conversation never got deep enough. Or atleast not to the depths this man is capable of going to when educating the masses. Perhaps that was intentional to keep the content relatable. I mean no disrespect by this and sincerely hope this does not come across as elitist in any way, but J Sai Deepak is a real treasure and brings such incisive reasoning that combined with his breadth of knowledge, his analysis creates a real perspective shift in those listening.  I hope Ranveer gets a chance to sit down with him again and go just a little bit deeper.  Specifically into his ideas on Dharmic civilizational values. Those are truly worth sharing and exploring. They help put into stark perspective what it is that we are losing due to these false leftist narratives around secularism. Or atleast they did for me who thought secularism was very important. For those reading this comment, if you haven't I would urge you to watch his other talks on the subject. And his sort of debate with Shashi Tharoor on his book launch where they had an interesting and rousing conversation on Savarkar's Hinduism vs Vivekananda's hinduism. A truly eye opening set of ideas.",1,0

Even after Independence the hindutva parties had people like Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyay saying the same thing but were brutally suppressed. In the 60's Shiv Sena Pramukh Shri. Balasaheb Thakare reiterated again and again the same concept but had to go alone in defending the hindutva stance in the 90's when Babri masjid was demolished. Time and again the appeasement of the vote banks took centrestage and these people were bypassed by the voters following popular vote banks politics by the Congress. This led to a large scale dissent in the country and now when the Hindu majority is consolidating it's vote the leftists are trying to cause dissension in their vote banks. Ultimately they try to harp on the two nation theory.When are they going to realize that it's not going to take place again and is a negative factor in the development of the nation and society as a whole. Long Live democracy in India. May the people come to know the true intentions of these people.,1,0

Hindi Translation:   ,   ,                      English Translation: May all sentient beings be at peace, may no one suffer from illness, May all see what is auspicious, may no one suffer. Om peace, peace, peace.  A very popular mantra, the original source is untraceable, some sources on the internet say that it is from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (1.4.14) but thats not true! We did do a background check on this and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad does not have this shlok. There were many other instances where we found this shlok either at the beginning of the book or at the end in a form of prayer. Nonetheless, such an altruistic shlok from our ancestors. How broad their minds were! Please share!    So here in this mantra we are praying for all, I mean all yonis on earth.  Dhanyavaad.  No pointing fingers just a clarity. Jai hind",2,0

Good decent educated family men are wary of hindu women on multi cultural campuses .    Hindu women are into alcohol and drugs and will do anything to show that they are Bollywood type.     This has been the case since 2004 . Been getting worse.      The Indian culture is reflected in the Bollywood films clearly.  I am not understanding what is there to be proud in hindu or sanatani?? Divorce rate among Indians diNs is growing bcuz india women want to be liberated. Which means they need to be going to dance clubs after getting married.  Among Telugu ppl open marriages and swinging is common.  Sorry Indians need to act like civilized humans again before talking about religion. Bollywood grew due to hindu religion .,1,2

I think somewhere in the end, a more satisfying justification started to emerge, which is about the motherland of the faith. Geographically and politcally, there are several nations that can accommodate persecuted Muslims, Christians, Jews and other flavours of Abrahamic faiths. However, being the land of origination of Sanatana Dharma, if India fails to extend a helping hand to the Hindu refugees, where else do you think can they find refuge? Another important concern is that about the hostility of our neighbours towards India. Whats the guarantee they wouldnt plant moles in the garb of refugees?  This law is not going to impact any existing Indian citizen, whichever faith they maybe following. Its only a selective intake thats being made by the govt which is well within their rights constitionally.",0,0

1984,2023-06-21T16:00:08Z,@rshas3,"Thoughts evoked by this discussion:  1. Will the people of the three major religions of Bharat  have a common vision for the country? The majority of them will, but the clergy and imams wont. That is the burning  issue that is tearing Bharat  apart.  2. To attract Desis to come back new urban centers need to be built devoid of the garbage that infects current cities. The Metroes are screwed. Goa has potential and so does Karnataka. Launching planned towns on the Konkan Coast would fit the bill.  3. Two of Bharats greatest gift to the world  are Yoga and Meditation. Dharma is too esoteric to internalise. Respect for Nature/Prakriti is hollow in Bharat. Family as an institution is not a gift. Art forms yes. Bharat  is the only country where Vegetarianism is practiced by a large number of people. While Bharatiyas are turning non veg, vegetarianism and its extreme form veganism is becoming popular in the developed word.  4. Please note Buddhism  is prevalent in Myanmar  and Sri Lanka  and the Buddhists there are brutal towards fellow human beings of different faiths. That blows the Ahimsa aspect of Buddhism in these two countries.  5. The intent of the Rajya Sabha is good. But it falls short of its intent. Whats the use of having people like Sachin Tendulkar, Jaya Badhuri, Rekha as members? What about people like Jairam Ramesh who has no kaam dandha since 2014? There should be term limits. What about engineers, architects, academics, industrialists, doctors? Maybe it should consist of eminent people who have accomplished what they set out to do and are willing to dedicate their time to the functioning of the RS. Elevating a Rajya Sabha member to PM is a joke. Also the requirement that a Cabinet Member should be an LS or RS member should be done away with. What about the State Legislative Council?  6. Negligible attention ought to be given to what the Western Press thinks of Bharat . It is biased. More attention to what Western politicians and bureaucrats have to say.  7. Trains that serve commuters that currently pack crowded compartments and hang onto windows should be introduced to squelch anger towards trains such as Vande Bharat. Making a big deal of these trains, rather than just introducing them would help.  8. Regarding International Optics, Yogi need not be as gregarious as Modi. Bharat  is now recognised as an important International player. Yogi would focus more on internal issues and interact with foreign partners on an as required basis.  9. It is depressing that Hindus have allowed state control of Mandirs for so long. Where are the protests? 10. What does J.Sai Deepak have to say about Bharats  judicial system? Bharat's  judicial system is an embarrassment and shameful. On the one hand Bharat  is sending missions to the Moon, Mars and launching satellites into space. And on the other hand the judicial process moves at a Bullock Cart's pace. The Judiciary is the third pillar of Bharat's  Democracy. What are the SC Judges doing? Their House is in a mess. It is the responsibility of the Judicial Pillar to suggest improvements. They have abdicated their responsibility for 75 Years. Needless ro say it encourages bad behaviour in people who break the law and get away with it because resolution takes years to be settle.",2,0

As he talks his thoughts just come out so crystal clear and makes us think on each and every word we go through. He also makes us believe to trust our intuitions with facts and search for most answers in history. One thing i also learned from him is study our history and not to repeat he mistakes.,173,2

He could be true about some points but he is being too generic about all Christians. I went to do some fact checks and he seems to not match atleast about Faran  Akhtar.  One premise cannot be deduced and concluded as a fact based on a single case.  But whatever it is I just admire the way he shares his arguments of which I too am learning about I would also say my Indian(which he likes to refer to as Bharat).,2,0

During those periods, they weren't such issues, but now that the BJP is in power (the RSS's core base for Hindus), some people are screaming that lots of Hindus have converted into Muslims and Christians. India is a vast and diversified nation. It harbours various cultures, traditions, religions, castes, languages, races, and ethnic groups. The conflict among the different communities of people can never be removed, but it can be accommodated. In India, the constitution ensures equal participation for all people, irrespective of differences. There is equal representation of the minority and the majority. The rights and interests of everyone are protected, irrespective of status or unity. India is a secular nation, and that guarantees each and every citizen the right to practise and profess their own religion without interference. People are united geographically, linguistically, and politically, which unites social diversity.",1,1

Eg: instead of taking the Indian constitution into the new parliament, he made it look lik some temple inauguration. This shows the mindset of him and his party. Every public property made in this country is a collective effort of every citizen, so a honest prsn would definitely say no to religious prayers or rituals in a public place. More over often we see modi chanting hindu slogans in public gatherings, for wat? If he is unbiased his common sense would warn him dat this nation is diverse, don't say these things in public gatherings, keep religion as a personal choice. So when a pm does these things openly, it's a sign for his useless followers to have a religiously superior mindset, that's when they start hitting and killing ppl for eating beef, doing moral policing etc(google for recent crimes). It's simple, through the common man's eyes we see a lot of flaws in this govt, if u find a prsn who says \""no everything is fine\"", definitely stop listening to him. He is biased.",3,3

In a  world where people are moving aheadfrom religion and the so-called culture associated with that and florishing, we are focused on making \""BHARAT\"" a cultured country based on cultures and practices decades ago( sarcasm:) ). The whole  concept of culture is not just to follow old , aged and flawed ones , its to reinvent and bring up new ones also.  The guest in the show bought up a reference to Kerala, As a person from Kerala, no one is asking for a hindu neighbourhood or Muslim neighborhood , we do not frankly care who or which religious background our neighbors are from , as long as we live in harmony. The one good thing about people from kerala is , we call out the cards , when they are jokers , thats why the ruling party failed to make a impression in kerala , since they played the religion card in kerala , people called it out.   Also from what he speaks what i gathered is he promotes Inida to go back to its roots and culture , but the truth, what is happening here is , snippets from Sai's speeches are getting cut and spread around spreading the pro hindu movement . The illiterate or common hindu man who sees this will have the notion that inida should be a all hindu nation and that the majority should deserve all the attention and the issues of the minority is none of a matter . The whole issue with involving religion with a country's culture is that people get very hell bend on forcing others on their traditions and so-called customs , as we have seen in the beef ban in north India . People who slaughtered and sold cattles where killed in certain places . So the question is , should you promoting the culture and customs (which is purely based on a religion ) of a majority and unintentionally undermining the minority .",0,0

Here is my problem with the 'centrist' discourse: you say you're objective, and you care about facts only, and that the left is a crazy population getting themselves off with a sense of superiority they feel for being left. I mostly agree with the last point, most of the people that represent left are like that and don't give two fucks about actual change or actual issues that the marginalized face. About the first two claims, I don't think that's very true. Because yes, I hear your arguments about the nation state, about a majority, (not really about honesty about the mughal dynasty, because that's more complicated topic. Tbh colonialism did more damage than anything else to the whole psyche of the population we call 'Indians'), I understand that there might be work being done in the background. But at the same time there is no conversation on the way the current government is gaining mass support- by tapping into the extreme hate people feel towards anything different from themselves. We're also not talking about what that does to a group of people. Frank Herbert wrote that it is up to the leader to maintain individuality in a group, because the lesser the individuality, the more possibility of a group becoming a mob. And that's exactly what's happening. And that's not okay. You want to govern, you want to bring law and order, cool hai. But enabling the worst impulses of the hindu mass, that's not okay. That's causing harm to people on individual levels, and will cause harm on a group level as well. And yeah, maybe the left is a problem. But what about the normal people who dont associate with anything? Who are scared of existing freely because someone might come and kill them someday for practicing a religion that they have inherited from their parents, converted forcefully centuries ago or not. You have to talk about that if you want to say you're having an honest conversation based on facts. You have to talk about the high caste, male figure that yogi presents himself as to gain support from those who have hatred and bias against those who are not that high caste male figure. Alarm bells dont just ring because of political discourse, they ring because our leaders and what they present themselves as is what shapes us as people. You would know, you must have people under you. And you're smart enough. Yet, in this entire conversation, not once is this mentioned or talked about. How is this an objective and 'centrist' conversation then? Why affiliate yourself with all factual truth when you're only choosing particular facts to present to your audience?",1,0

2508,2023-05-31T15:07:09Z,@ap-ut3qo,"i asked ChatGPT AI to draw a comparison between hitler's nazi germany and the current BJP led republic of India.   1. Rise to power: Both Nazi Germany and the current political situation in India witnessed the rise of populist leaders who appealed to a sense of nationalism and made promises of restoring the country's former glory. Adolf Hitler capitalized on the economic and political instability in Germany during the early 1930s, while the current ruling party in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has presented itself as a nationalist force that aims to establish a Hindu majoritarian rule.  2. Authoritarian tendencies: Hitler's Nazi regime was characterized by its authoritarian nature, centralized power, and the suppression of dissenting voices. In India, there have been concerns raised about the erosion of democratic values and the concentration of power in the hands of the ruling party. Critics argue that the current government has stifled dissent, curtailed media freedom, and targeted political opponents.  3. Discrimination and marginalization: Nazi Germany implemented a systematic policy of discrimination and persecution, particularly targeting Jews, as well as other minority groups. In India, concerns have been raised about the marginalization and discrimination faced by religious minorities, particularly Muslims and Christians, through policies such as the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).  4. Nationalistic propaganda: Hitler's Nazi Germany used propaganda extensively to shape public opinion and consolidate power. Similarly, in India, there have been accusations of the ruling party using nationalist narratives and divisive rhetoric to further its political agenda and create a sense of \""us vs. them\"" among different religious and ethnic groups.  5. Human rights abuses: Nazi Germany is infamous for its widespread human rights abuses, including the Holocaust and other atrocities committed during World War II. While the current situation in India cannot be equated with the scale of those crimes, there have been concerns raised about human rights violations, including instances of mob violence, hate crimes, and the curtailing of civil liberties.",0,0

2578,2023-05-29T10:30:00Z,@tarass8737,"When i was doing my graduation from the top college in Delhi university and then my master's from JNU. I thought I'd make a career in academics, although in graduation itself my faith in the integrity of the academic community was shaken also fewer and fewer of my friends were still holding on to their worldview and increasingly going astray because it was extremely easy to completely brainwashed, its kind of  a conversion through subliminal messaging that happens in academic spaces in delhi infact I think almost every university, however i can only speak of delhi I'm not sure about other universities in other cities and states. It was almost this hypnotic force that was out to get every hindu or indic who knew exactly what her/his history was and then by the time i was in MA in JNU I felt like I was the only person left who could still think for themselves and didnt become leftist zombies. I felt extremely isolated. The left lures you with the idea of a land which would be so free everybody loves one another and there is openness when it comes to sexuality and drugs. The time i passed from my masters i was so disillusioned. The language used and spoken in the academic world formally, the language you write in your research papers and thesis is already so twisted and already so almost anti indic that its impossible to find a middle ground without forsaking your principles and beliefs. When i enrolled for phd in MSU in Gujarat that was the last straw for me because even there to some extent i just knew i could not do this, this isnt for me. I backed out of the PhD. They literally break you and if you are ambitious enough or someone who values miney and luxury over integrity you'll make it in the academic world and even bwcome and IAS officer, otherwise they'll make it almost impossible for you to be anywhere in any rank in these spaces. I had began to think that there is no hope and this nation is doomed because places of education are hijacked by these people but i think its was three years ago that i discovered j sai Deepak with whom literally all my thoughts aligned and it was almost as if someone was saying what i had been saying in my little spaces like my social media etc. He gave me hope. My worry today is that casteism is going to be the doom of Sanatan dharma and i can bet on it unless people make a very concious effort to give up and dissociate themselves from this superiority or inferiority complexes given by this caste system. We desperately need to get rid of it, its a parasite that we arent identifying but its just as dangerous as an anti india element.",52,4

But the only thing I didn't like is his inclination towards the film actor Pawan Kalyan who has no idea about his own Telugu neighbouring state Telangana. Pawan Kalyan is the most ill-informed person who hates Telangana and it's people just because our dialect is different than the Andhra dialect. How can someone like J. Sai Deepak like him especially when he had no respect for the people of Telangana and their struggle. People like S.S.Raja Mouli and Pawan Kalyan they don't even value the freedom fighters of Telangana like Komuram Bheem. They made an entire fictional film like RRR to project him wrong.,0,0

His line that i do not trust a Pakistani or a Bangladeshi Muslim just shows his mindset. A persecuted individual is persecuted. And when our constitution does not segregate on the basis of religion, who the hell is BJP and people like him. Coming to the second point there are no bloody jobs  for people in this country and now they want to get in more people. So fix your own house first. Then this guy becomes a shameless bigot. Everything for him is tied to the religion. Ambedkar could have said what he said but this is where your rationalizing part should step in. Ambedkar was a human too. He too had flaws.  Sai Deepak is a very repulsive character..  This bigot should Learn to be decent human first. The true native of this land are the tribals. This land is so diverse that one cannot paint it with one brush. Yet this man continues to do so with ease. Talking in English the language of Abrahamic religion he so passionately detest.

2800,2023-05-24T00:17:26Z,@eonabhishek," Core Philosophy of Hinduism (the way of life) or better understood as Sanatan Dharma (the eternal right thing to do).   A. Key Concepts:  1. Brahman ~ The Supreme Existence or absolute reality. There are no millions of gods and goddesses but only many manifestations of the same supreme Brahman (cosmic energy and consciousness). 2. Dharma ~ that which accomplices the three tasks of keeping the set up of the society in excellent condition, bringing about the worldly progress of every living being, and facilitating their progress in the spiritual realm as well (attaining Moksha/Nirvana). 3. Samsara ~ The Continuous cycle of life, death, and reincarnation (like Big Bang and Big Crunch and at the cusp of transcending).  4. Karma ~ The Universal Law of Cause and Effect that one's actions and thoughts directly determine their current and future life similar to Newton's Third Law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction (Action and Acceptance).  5. Purushartha ~ Inherent Values of the Universe (object of the human pursuit) - Artha (Economic Value). Kama (Pleasures). Dharma (righteousness). Moksha (liberation). 6. Atman (the belief in the soul) ~ all living creatures have a soul, and they all are part of the supreme soul (Brahman).  7. SAT-CHIT-ANANDA ~ God or Brahman is referred to as Sat-Chit-Ananda or Sachchidananda (- ). It means \""Being, Consciousness, Bliss\"". It is a description of the subjective experience of Brahman. This sublimely blissful experience of boundless, pure consciousness is a glimpse of ultimate reality. \""Sat-Chit-Ananda\"" or \""Sachchidananda\"" is the Sanskrit compound form of the word, which can be translated as \""Eternal Consciousness Bliss\"", or \""Absolute Consciousness Bliss\"", or \""Consisting of existence and thought and joy\"". SAT means Truth, Existence or Pure Being, Chit means Consciousness, and Ananda means Bliss. 8. Sthitpragya [] - When one discards all selfish desires and cravings of the senses that torment the mind and becomes satisfied in the realization of the self, such a person is said to be transcendentally situated. [       2.55]   B. The Mahavakyas from Upanishads ~ The Great Sayings  1. Tat Tvam Asi (That You Are) ~ the very nature of all existence as permeated by the finest essence.  2. Ahm Brahmasmi ~ I am Brahman (divine)  3. Prajnanam Brahma ~ Brahman is Prajnana (the highest and purest form of wisdom, intelligence, and understanding).  4. Ayam Atma Brahma ~ This Self (Atman) is Brahman (divine).  C. Six Schools [principal darshans] of Hindu Philosophy  1. Vaisheshika (Kanada) ~ Science of Logic and Futility of Maya - The Vaisheshika school attempts to identify, inventory, and classify the entities and their relations that present themselves to human perceptions. It lists six categories of being (Padarthas), to which was later added a seventh. These are (I) Dravya, or substance, the substratum that exists independently of all other categories and the material cause of all compound things produced from it. Dravyas are nine in number: earth, water, fire, air, ether, time, space, spirit, and mind. (ii) Guna, or quality, which in turn is subdivided into 24 species. (iii) Karma or action. Both guna and karma inhere within Dravya and cannot exist independently of it. (iv) Samanya, or genus, denotes characteristic similarities that allow two or more objects to be classed together. (v) Vishesha, or specific difference, which singles out an individual of that class. (vi) Samavaya, or inherence, indicates that things are inseparably connected. (vii) To these six was later added Abhava, nonexistence or absence.   2. Nyaya (Gautama) ~ Logical quest for god and phases of creation - Its ultimate concern is to bring an end to human suffering, which results from ignorance of reality. Liberation is brought about through the right knowledge. Nyaya is thus concerned with the means of right knowledge.   3. Yoga (Patanjali) ~ Practice meditation and Samadhi for Reunification - Yoga holds with Samkhya that the achievement of spiritual liberation (moksha) occurs when the spirit (purusha) is freed from the bondage of matter (Prakriti) that has resulted from ignorance and illusion.    4. Sankhya (Kapil) ~ Eliminate physical and mental pains and receive liberation - the consistent dualism of matter (Prakriti) and the eternal spirit (purusha). The two are originally separate, but in the course of evolution, Purusha mistakenly identifies itself with aspects of Prakriti. Right knowledge consists of the ability of Purusha to distinguish itself from Prakriti.  5. Vedanta (Veda Vyas) ~ Explains the divine nature of the soul, Maya, and creation (Conclusion) - Vedanta is also referred to as Vedanta Mimamsa (Reflection on Vedanta), Uttara Mimamsa (Reflection on the Latter Part of the Vedas), and Brahma Mimamsa (Reflection on Brahman).   6. Mimansa (Jaimini) ~ Explains Vedas are eternal and divine (Reflection or Critical Investigation) - The aim of Mimamsa is to give rules for the interpretation of the Vedas, the earliest scriptures of Hinduism and to provide a philosophical justification for the observance of Vedic ritual. Because Mimamsa is concerned with the earlier parts of the Vedas (called the Karmakanda), it is also referred to as Purva-Mimamsa (Prior Study) or Karma-Mimamsa (Study of Actions). Vedanta, which deals with the later portion of Vedic literature called the Upanishads, is called Uttara-Mimamsa (Posterior Study) or Jnana-Mimamsa (Study of Knowledge).  The Brahman (the cosmic energy that neither can be created nor be destroyed but only transcends through various karmic cycles) is Adi Anadi (ever-existing) even in the nothingness, and that's why Hindus practice Namaste as a form of greeting knowing and understanding that there is Brahman within the other living being as well.",1,0

Nobody is stopping them and moreover they'll be protected by these hindu senas.   And plz do not extrapolate your saffronic views by showing demographic imbalance. What does he mean by imbalance? Does he mean that hindus must always be in majority, so that they can trample upon the minority and say that hindus are safe. The safety should be ensured by the rule of law not from any X, Y or Z becoming a majority. The point of being a majority or minority shouldn't overpower the rule of law.",4,5

They tend to start a fight on very simple issue but not wanting to address and resolve the issue, they start fighting even in south Delhi.

He is just being a torchbearer from whose light we are able to gain some vision and walk through it. He is awakening us. Awakening the masses is the divine's job and he is nothing less than one. A force to recon with.  And to all the fellow Bharathiyas, lets spread his voice to our maximum potential. May his video snippets be circulated, may his books be the bestsellers, may we buy his books and gift them to people, may we adorn our Santana identity in some way or the other, Lets help our local temple, lets go visit our KulaDev temple at least once a year and most importantly, lets be highly equipped with facts and try and be knowledgeable in tackling these leftists and libtards who pretend to be in the guise of secularism, pluralism and the hypocritic universal brotherhood, who know nothing but to distort facts and thrust upon us their vile propaganda.

(negatively)......... and never did pawan kalyan came out and criticiz those words.........................i may agree about the fact that he is knowledgeable.......but its waste of ur knowl. if u dont take a stand and fight for a cause always......if ur speeches are seasonal and ocassional then whats the use ? ik he has a great loyal fanbase.......but these are the questions raised by some of the same fans(die hard fans) .      i hope pk starts standding for himself instead of being used by other parties for sake of his craze.    edit1- pawan kalyan supports kcr of brs completely and hails him as great cm.........but the same kcr hates modi govt. and modi .......! but y dont pawan kalyan criticize kcr for that or stand for modi!!                  god where does he stand and what does he stand for!! if u really admire modi then come out and stand for him when someone says something against him!!!

3507,2023-05-14T16:42:19Z,@akashwasnik3005,"1. Well, someone needs to tell the fanatics to be mindful of the repercussions of their own actions that are/will/may going/go against humanity just for the sake of them being devout.  They need to be told that a religion cannot even stand without a crutch called the people, but converse is NOT TRUE. They need to be reminded time and again that a religion is like a fish and people are the water of the ocean. One can only imagine what will happen to a fish without water.  2. Can you expect fanatics to ever advocate human rights at the cost of them being at loggerheads with their own faith/religion? If someone does that on your behalf, whom you call THE LEFT, how does that qualify for them feeding demonization and victimization?  3. The honest conversation which you want to have with the people of different faiths (Both of you, right wingers eliminating completely The Left), what fruitful outcome do you hope to have? Do you expect them to listen to your assertions? Try imposing your ideology onto them, retaliation will ensue. Can a layman expect himself to be under salvation of any of the religion(except Buddhism) when that very religion is not centred around humans and their interests, thanks to deification of aliens And can anytime, without hesitation, eliminate the very layman from existence if he wishes/continues to challenge that religion?  4. It is not the killing of a mafia don resulting into a specific community feeling victimized,  a) It is the sheer mockery of law and order in the state in which the don was killed in front of the police and mind you, police specialising in encounters, instead of capturing the murderers, ran for their lives, b) And more importantly, it was the murderers reciting chants specifically considered reverential towards a deity of that particular faith, which gives you a fair amount of idea of the extent of communal tensions within the state resulting into the other community feeling systematically victimized.  5. Oh come on JSD.  Kerala is by far the state with highest literacy rate. The Hindus there, even consume cow beef. They are so much thoughtfully advanced than the rest of the parts of the country that you can't find a single trace of communal tensions within the state.   The thing which you are talking about Kerala's Christian community feeling safe and secure under Hindu majority, has to do with the education of not just the minorities but more importantly, The Majority i.e. The Hindus. When minorities AS WELL AS THE MAJORITY obtain similar education, one gets to observe SECULARISM practiced at its peak.  The majority tends to become benign towards the minority by virtue of education. Hindus are no exception, can happen with any majority. When a majority is benign towards its minorities, it is only natural for the minorities to feel safe and secure under a benevolent majority.  A state driven by intellectual prowess has not much room for religious topics of conflict. Try asking minorities of the states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, etc.  I wonder what their reply would be?  6. There are far more dire things to be addressed than the revisitation of the constitution. Even from an Indian perspective. Besides, you being an advocate would surely be knowing that constitution has provisions for its amendment(probably you are dissatisfied with it). I hope by revisitation you didn't mean complete rejection of the basic structure of the constitution.  You would want to inculcate in the youth, discipline by mainstreaming some part of services in the armed forces. It has worked incredibly well in Israel.  i) I wonder whether the \""bhartiya\"" youth would welcome such a law or mandate(call it whatever you want) where they would be treated as merely factory products expected to be contributing to nation's overall development rather than focusing on their self development which would culminate in the nation being developed?  ii) Isn't that you, coercing your ideology (borrowed model of another country) onto the youth which may or may not prove beneficial to them and to the nation eventually?  Yes, revisitation of the education system is one of the dire things to be addressed. Not exactly the way you are proposing, but under the guidance of most objective think tanks one can imagine, competent and shrewd in their respective domains.  Wasted last point, which is an infinitesimal issue(about the temple control by state) and it is not even a concern, forget abt grave concern, to the masses.  I guess it is pointless to expect from money-minded extreme right wingers like you, to be working on some real issues such as alleviation of poverty, unemployment, etc.   As long as your wardrobe is filled with all famous brands from the last 5 years(It's surprising if not ironic though. I thought your wardrobe would be filled with traditional Bhartiya apparel given the biggest proponent of Bhartiya Sanskriti, as you claim yourself to be. Are you trying to deceive people by encouraging people to hold fast to the ideology of saving the Bhartiya Sanskriti whilst you continue to enjoy wearing western outfits?) you don't feel a need to raise the above-mentioned real issues.  It is great that you don't have a disposition towards politics cuz what I can make out from your reply is that you sound dictatorial in the most gracious manner possible.  The current dictator is enough to open the eyes of innocent and ignorant people.  Nobody wants a second dictator.  7. I don't know why people keep saying Buddhism has taken some essence from Hinduism and repackaged itself.  i) This goes on to raise serious questions on the authenticity of The Buddha's teachings. ii) This makes Samrat Ashoka look like a fool in taking refuge in The Buddha's Dhamma as why did he convert from Hinduism when everything is the same? iii) This raises serious questions on the intellect of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar who said more than half a century ago, \""I may have born as a Hindu, but I shall not die as one\"", in taking refuge into The Buddha's Dhamma and single-handedly revitalizing the dying Buddhism from India.  BUT those making such statements must bear in mind that their claims are not infallible.  a) Atleast Buddha (the enlightened one) was one of the first logical beings of his time and thereafter, who renunciated the presence of divine which Hinduism upholds to this day.   b) Atleast Buddha was the first logical being to rebel against the killing of bovines(including cows) or any other sentient being for that matter, AS AN OBLATION practiced by the Brahmins in the name of worshipping/satisfying the deity only to confer back on them whatever the host of the ritual wished for, back in the day.  c) Atleast Buddha was one of the first logical beings to reject the self proclaimed infallible nature of the Hindu scriptures or any other scriptures thereafter for that matter.  Buddhism was seen as a rival by both Hinduism/Brahminism and Jainism and was the most popular among the people at the time and rightfully so. It has undergone systematic degradation to the point of getting extinct from India during the 19th century at the hands of its aforementioned envious contemporaries. If that doesn't put across the significant differences between the two \""religion\"", I don't know what will. I always wondered where the word \""buddhu\"" (meaning \""a foolish person\"" in Hindi) came from?  Now I know, to whom it was and is derogatory and coined by whom.  Besides, when someone says Buddhism is born out of Hinduism, it is absurd if not folly.  As,  Why did The Buddhism came into being? What was lacking in the Hinduism that was unbearable to The Buddha that he chose a different path?  Hindu scholars who boast about Buddhism being born out of Hinduism are essentially pointing to the common superficial terms in both Hinduism and Buddhism like reincarnation, karma and that life of devotion and honour is a path to salvation and enlightenment. But, when you get to the depth of these terms is when you realise there are significant differences in the MEANING of the terms as defined by both the religions.  For instance let's take the statement, the life of devotion and honour is a path to salvation and enlightenment.   The Buddha upheld the virtue and the noble eightfold path as the way to reach nibbana.   Contrary to this, Hinduism upholds deity worship, rituals(including sacrifices erstwhile and possibly till date) and becoming Brahmin by gaining knowledge as the way to reach enlightenment.  8. What do you mean, when after being asked that \""Do you think that The Left is cool?\"", to which you replied, \""Yes. STILL.\""?  What does STILL imply? Is there something dire happening/that has happened in the country which you think should have upset/made uncomfortable The Left as to gradually start exposing themselves? What do you expect The Left to do? To loose its cool and aggressively engage with extreme right wingers like you about some ordeal?  9. If by the support systems apart from the family, you mean supports such as domestic help service which you pay for, which you claim isn't available in The Left dominant countries, you know better than myself, it has to do with poverty which again is a dent on country's overall development. Had Bharat done away with poverty, you and I would be supporting ourselves for our chores, which by no means is a menial job btw.  I mean you ostensibly TRIED to establish your open-minded approach towards any job when you said, what's wrong with snake charming.  10. One really needs to listen to you in 0.75x speed in order to NOT get enthralled by your English and just focus on the context. You know your game, to speak so fast as to not allow to clearly register what you are trying to say for the most part.  It may be that I am lazy, but listening to this podcast in 0.75x speed, I am surprised at what JSD claims to lack, which is patience for laziness and mediocrity, himself possesses MEDIOCRITY.",0,0

And ofcourse a big thanks to Ranveer and the team for the  hard work you are doing to bring diverse perspectives on the table and enlightening students .

With implementation of NRC, it is on the onus of citizens to prove their citizenship. Many in rural India do not have paperwork and arr illiterate. Now with CAA all hindus, christians etc. are protected leaving muslim indians to be vunerable. As an Indian we must embrace diversity and live in peace and harmony with all the communities.",0,0

3833,2023-05-12T14:35:28Z,@johnsonk748,"I am a proud Bharatiya. I am spiritually Christian but culturally I am a hindu. I absolutely love and admire JSD. He is one of the main reasons I moved away from propagandist  left wing to Indic wing.   As a Christian, I feel more safer in India with hindus being in majority than the peaceful community. Because, for the peaceful community, as long as they are in minority they want secular law and once they become majority, they impose sharia law. This is not the case just in India, but it is happening rapidly in the Europe and I live in the UK.  Like JSD mentioned, Europe has let lot of immigrants in the past and they are suffering now. That's why right wing nationalism is on rise in Europe which is termed as Islamophobic by so-called woke idiots.   I believe the essence and fabric of Bharath will stay intact as long as we Indians irrespective of any religion are deep rooted to our culture.   For this, we need more modern day freedom fighters like JSD to educate people more about the truth of our identity.   Great job, TRS, for bringing this gem onto your show!",449,27

You might have only meet Bombay elites that doesn't mean that only Bombay elites are leftist. You can not make such incorrect statement on such a platform.

Like here AJIO has partnered with TRS/ Ranveer. Bcoz in someway they will influence him to meet their agenda today or tom.AJIO also is we dig up.. its owned by people who have vested interests in govt. they will first feed the channel probably with money or viewership.. and slowly force the channel to go their way. That is why today all news channels are biased towards the political party funding them. So if the idea is be centrist  like u say Ranveer.. and I guess u dont have shortage of money and viewership.. dont fall the same trap. I can see where everything in the background is blurred in the bookshelf only AJIO is readable. Handing the gift I felt like watching Coffee with Karan where ppl come for the hamper",1,0

My expected questions were listed below and if in future he come back then please ask him( i madly wants to see him again in TRS) 1. Indic revolution: how the revolution of Sanatan dharma, our civilization stalled after shankaracharya to swami vivekanand and how we enlighten our bharat youngsters? We are seeing zihad to conversion rapidly which some organised system is precisely stoping to come out and defending it nurturing it and even spreading narratives and propaganda. We don't have now freely say jai shree ram and how RSS or related organisation painted as extremists that's really not true. 2. What will be the future of bharat? How you perceive it? Developed just like Europe without identity and civilization or strong economy with awareness of Indic culture and tradition awareness youths? Where we are heading? 3. Geopolitics questions, who's with us? Why and who are friends and foes? USA/Russia. 4. UCC and constitution from DR ambedkar ji real written perspective. 5.

When we say what is saftey of Muslims and Christians he just pointed to one state and he wants democracy country sayings Hindus should me majority where he is saying it should be left to people's choice what religion what they want and only tangents to Muslims ..he supported kK Muhammad for only temple reconstruction i dont understand how he is neutral guy ...

4422,2023-05-10T04:41:15Z,@drake5308,"Hey great episode. Some things I agreed some quite not.  I have some female friends from Bihar. For them the main issue is the way women are treated. Misogyny and patriarchy ( dowry , demand for virgin bride) is through the roof! They consider themselves to be lucky to be able to get out and move to Kolkata where they are treated with respect and dignity. I just hope and pray the circumstances improve where people donot have to flee from a place for things as basic as respect dignity and safety.  He should have spoken about improving the female force participation. As a country where one half section of the society is not earning automatically puts the nation in back gear. According to the official data, the female force participation has plummeted than ever before. Reasons being child care where till today the mother is considered as a primary care giver, domestic responsibility etc etc. It is 2023. Overall development should be a goal rather than religion class caste or gender.  The thing about Europe is they are going through crisis which I agree. That does not mean there is nothing good to learn from them. Most egalitarian countries are in Europe. Be it child care, unemployment benefits, breaking gender stereotypes , legalization of lgbtqa+ basically treating human beings as humans. We can implement such policies.  There is a long road ahead. In this world where communication and exchange of ideas as become better than ever, our aim should be to imbibe and inculcate the better ones and scrape out the redundant ones.",0,0

Even Muslims don't go to Muslim fakirs saints who shower love on people of all religions. Infact they tried to kill fakirs like saibaba who took everybody into his arms. I just don't see any hope.

For example beastly people were treated rough while the more civilized ones were treated with leniency by those colonizers. Now, we live more or less in a free world as all those colonized nations are free and sovereign nations and you shall observe that there are nations with Christian majorities while there are with Muslim majorities and then their are Buddhist nations, Jewish nation and so on. The point to realize is that while there are honest Christian nations as well as the dishonest ones and similarly there are honest Muslim nations and also dishonest Muslim nations as there are honest Buddhist nations and dishonest ones. Have you noticed that there are two Hindu majority nations, India and Nepal and both rank very low in honesty index of the transparency International index. Is there something wrong with us totally ? Its rats like Sai Deepak who try to sound intellectuals and deluded masses listen to them blindly without anyone from those listeners going for any introspection. You should not let these kinds of guys on your show or give them any recognition as such factors are the ones who have eroded Indias democracy in the recent years.",0,0

I have been watching beerbiceps podcasts on YouTube for so long. There is a certain depth and connection I have felt in all the interviews. No thanks to the segment, I felt completely disconnected after it was over. It is absurd and just not what I expected out of a video featuring J Sai Deepak. I was waiting for him to come on TRS and this is what I got in the end. Absolutely disappointing! I won't mind if the videos start with the segment as it will be like an introduction to the celebrity. BUT NOT IN THE MIDDLE SOMEWHERE. Please!!  2. I understand sponsorships come with a baggage but I urge you all to not get carried away with it. Don't compromise on your quality to earn money, like most businesses nowadays. It will be a huge disappointment for viewers like me if Ranveer Alhabadiya and TRS does this. Please go back Ranveer and watch your interview with Mr. Anupam Kher.

It is no surprise given his association with the RSS that he espouses hatred towards Muslims. However, he appears to be unaware of the fact that an Indian man in Australia has been charged with raping over 52 women, and he was reported to have had ties to the RSS.        Multiple counts of rape, 17 counts of intimate recordings without consent, six counts of using intoxicating substances to commit indictable offence, assault with an act of indecency  its a case that has shocked the Indian community in Australia. And the man convicted  Balesh Dhankhar  is an Indian-Australian living in Sydney.  A media report on April 24 said that the district court in Sydney found Dhankhar found guilty of raping five Korean women in the city, describing him as \""won of the worst rapists\"" in the country's history.  Dhankhar, well known among the Indian community in the city, had earlier pleaded not guilty to 39 charges in total, claiming these acts were consensual. These crimes were committed between January and October 2018. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Dhankhar cried as the jury foreman replied \""guilty\"" to each of the 39 charges against him. He was refused bail.  The report said Dhankhar will be sentenced later in the year.",2,0

Why is up/bihar still shit today ??  ONE SIMPLE ANSWER - Because of average people there  Its very eaasy to blame system and government for everything . BUT WHO CHOSES THAT GOVERNMENT ??? Its the people living there . Who makes the system ?? Its the people who live there . Simple answer is voting based on caste and religion to get favours by government THEN blaming the same goverment for doing caste politics . Being corrupt in every way possible , but also blaming goverment officials for corruption .  Only positve side of up/bihar is that they are hardworking , and hence they are MAJDURS . As thats the only place for people who are corrupt and unintelligent BUT hardworking . Today no company wants to open a branch in up why ?? because people there are corrupt AF  , they are always looking for opportunies to exploits others   They wont be having roads and electrcity but will be fighting over petty religious things like making mandirs and what to eat , what to wear .",0,0

And, most of the dialogues do not reach a conclusion.   Now juxtapose this with the Social Media today.   It exists in echo chambers.   If you support political party X or ideology X, you would only be shown content that aligns with that belief system.   You are exposed to NO NEW ideas.

Only difference is Sai is very sharp and comments only when he is 120% sure of what he is saying.  I can understand this is the 1st episode and its like a warm up for viewers. I hope you keep calling him back and talk to him on specific topics on each episode just like you do with Abhijit.  Some more feedback about format: Please stop saying shit unnecessary. Its disrespecting and uncalled for.  Keep an eye on more feedback on rapid fire round. I did not particularly like it personally.  Otherwise: Thankyou for inviting Sai.,3,0

Been following him for a while now and the sheer ability he possesses to articulate incredible ideas and concepts, for the benefit of Bharat, is insane. Bharat has to protect these personas at any cost so that they could continue to empower the citizens and potentially shatter mental limits of asinine left which is holding the country back significantly.  More of humans like him, Abhijit Chavda, Rajiv Malhotra and Col Bharwan need to be on literal repeat on your show Ranveer so that India can learn and grow at a much faster pace. Really appreciate this channel and the work you and your team are doing to provide us a great amount of knowledge from these awesome interviews. Thank you   P.s.

5912,2023-05-07T05:20:20Z,@uncensore1,"Its great that Ranveer is bringing great speakers like j sai deepak. but what i feel is the episode should have focused more on j sai deepak's core competencies than his personal life. J Sai deepak is not a film-star for us to know whats in his wardrobe or what perfume he likes.  J Sai Deepak can give more content on spirituality, religion, caste system, history, temples than any other person. He is like a combination of powers of Abhijit chavda, Praveen mohan and some of rajshri nandy or Sri M.   Ranveer should have first read his book before the podcast. If only Ranveer wanted to ask personal questions to Sai it could have been about his failure of Sabrimala case. Or rather more personal question could have been - Sai baba (Shirdi Sai and Sathya Sai) always talks about unity of all religions, and Sai Deepak shares shares their name, so what are his opinions about their teachings.   In fact Ranveer can go more deeper by asking Sai Deepak about temples. Topics like ancient Indian temples and their practices, temple diversity and how will current systems handle the misuse of freedom of temples, relevance of kshetrapalakas (temple protectors) in today's modern India. role of temples in education systems of ancient India and if its practical today. Ancient Indian scriptures(particularly manusmriti), caste system vs varna system. Differences in languages, rituals, practices, deity worship based on different regions of diverse India and how to bring together everything under a single umbrella. Western view of sanctum sanctorum vs Indian belief system that includes sanskrit terms like murti, prana pratishtata, garbha gruha, shilpa shastras.   There is lot of spirituality in just the word Dharma and its relevance in today. Please create more episodes  with J Sai deepak focusing more on content than the person.",0,3

You are no where near those stalwarts and have just found your relevance within these times of left bashing.

They are fishing souls with bible hook. Evangelicals instinct of Christian neighbours will softly prepare them for closet Christian and hit them when they are most vulnerable  they are no less fanatic than Muslim when it comes to target Hindus for conversion. They are firm believers that all land belong to Yehova god and have to convert everyone to Christianity. Love crusade is also being done by Christians on the ground I personally know 5 cases where Christian family forced hindu girls to convert to  Christianity before marriage and all theirs kids are now Christians.  no issue with Christians if they stop evangelising , attacking and wiping off our civilisation from earth  just check their north east population census of last 100 years and you will see how they have wiped off native faith system. Also , promoting violence is also part of strategy details just remember slogan Nagaland for Christ,  crypto Christian prabhkaran fighting for separate Tamil Christian state powered by hardcore Christians Norway country , money for Shahen bag given by 4 churches etc etc ",0,0

Meanwhile, the budget allocation for the welfare of religious minorities has increased by a whopping 340%.!!! All the Christian majority states in India are now ruled by the BJP.

He does not fit into Indian Culture you want to bring it up - I have more than 5 facts from the statements he made.      a. He has divorced 3 times and was in Live-in relationship more than once, is it the Hindu Culture you want to bring      b. He is not a believer in God at all - He says he would have joined Naxals, His father lights cigarette with the Deeptam kept at home Mandir.       c. He our-rightly supports KCR a pro muslim coilation with Owaisi's All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM)      d. Just to appease Christians, His statement in Dec, 2021 - Jesus Christ was the messiah of the God who had taken birth on the earth as a human being. He loved human beings and awakened them. On behalf of me and of Jana Sena ranks, I extend my greetings to all those who praise Jesus and repose faith in him.       e. He multiple times stated he feels proud to be atheist, but took UTurn again for Political purposes. He took UTurns on multiple things not just religious beliefs.   2. He has fought last elections with Coalition of Communist, the leftists you talk about. So you have not done the fact check 3. He encourages caste based politics and blames his caste people for not voting for him in the last elections where he contested from his caste majority areas of Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram 4. He is Corrupt and a Lier - I can present facts and share articles. 5. He is hate driven and No agenda for development of his Party. He has been in politics since 2008 (Youth president of his Brothers Party Praja Rajyam) and has been never elected - What a politician he is?  Coupling with your argument of Thirupathi and the fact that AP CM Jagan is a Christian, I can understand why you sidelines the facts about Pawan Kalyan and chose him to be in your team.",1,1

But isn't it that the peace is disrupted and hate is created by elements in right wing as well. For example, the so called bajrang dal, VHP, Hindu Mahasabha etc?  If the left is feeding demonization, how is it that the right is not feeding it? Haven't they all used religion as a basis of creating differences in society everytime whenever they have wanted to come to power? Has the right wing not taken over its entire control over the media? And you open any news channel and see, the media is now amplifying hatred. Have they not used headlines with anti-hindu hashtags to feed victimisation among the hindus, now and then, over the past few years? So the media is amplifying hatred. And under who's protection?

6999,2023-05-06T10:23:54Z,@Vladimir_Lenin_,"I'm from Kerala.  This dude is making stuffs up and he's extremely selective of his topics on CAA (which I'll explain later on below).  Before i make my points, let me remind you that Sai deepak has a law degree in intellectual property. He's not proficient in in constitution of india. He's is a right winger, who advocates for hindu rashtra, hindutva and other related crap (as is evident from the video).   Coming to Kerala, a retired cop is not an authentic source. If you really wanna quote personal experiences as source, then you're on shaky grounds, cuz I'd quote the Kerala governor himself who said that in Kerala, people live in religious harmony. As stupid as such arguments sound, how about look at official reports instead of personal experiences? Lets see what National investigation agency (NIA) has to say. Just google \""NIA probe into love jihad\"". You'll get plenty of links on NIA probes that say, that there no such thing as a love jihad.   Coming to CAA. The dude is being very selective here as though there's no problem at all. I agree CAA does not cause any issues among the indian muslims. The problem arises when its implemented along with NRC.  NRC requires people of india to produce certificate or proof of indian citizenship. Learning from the experiences in assam (where the NRC was implemented), 19 million people could not prove their citizenship. Of the 19 million, 6 million were Hindus. These hindus will how ever get citizenship via CAA (because CAA provides citizenship to Hindus, shikhs, buddhusts, christians, jains and parsis. And not muslims).  So if nrc is carried out nation wide, there will be many hindus, muslims, sikhs, christians etc who will not be able to prove their citizenship. Among these people, all except muslims will get citizenship via CAA. The muslims will be deported.  Edit- 6 lakhs instead of 6 million, were Bengali Hindus.",3,20

But unless you wear the shoes of other communities you have no idea what they are going through. All this demolition killing is totally ok for him.

For me, I don't know much about constitutional rights like him being an advocate, being a citizen of my own country is being questioned is not Okay, I have been facing this from my childhood irrespective of any governments but intensity of that is much higher than before and my PM is silent on crucial unity of our own citizens which itself proves no leadership. I strongly feel we are going onto another Israel if we copy everything from them, it's dangerously wrong for any country. Mr. Advocate gives example of namesake muslims of kk Muhammad and apj Abdul Kalam, I'm inspired by Abdul Kalam a lot as a citizen not as a Muslim because he was not a practicing Muslim, he was a pleasing muslim and kk Muhammed involved in renovation of temples, that's why advocate likes them, if not he won't. This seems to be a one-sided mind. And everyone can talk about anything simply looking at some biased books or newspapers or paid media saying them as facts. Be neutral minded and sense positives and negatives in everyone, religion is not a public thing to decide or impose on, it's personal belief and please don't divide us and rule as Britishers did in the past.

After eagerly anticipating the appearance of the illustrious J Sai Deepak on TRS for an extended period of time, it was truly a dream come true. J Sai's unbridled authenticity was resoundingly apparent as he expounded his unwavering stance on topics ranging from Hindutva to the liberation of temples from state control, Indian History, and Indian Political scenario going forward (Left beware ). He possesses an awe inspiring wealth of knowledge on a multitude of subjects which he communicates with exceptional lucidity, never once shying away from speaking truth to power despite contravening the popular narrative. Ranveer meanwhile proved to be an exceptional moderator deftly balancing J Sai's erudition on a range of topics and posed incisive questions with remarkable precision.   It was entertaining and educating. But I believe next time J Sai's on the show, it should revolve around one or two particular topics. That's how I believe the masses who know him love to hear him.

7221,2023-05-06T08:52:49Z,@kartikdubey762,"Hey @Ranveer! I have a few suggestions for more effective communication. I know I am giving free advice, but I have learnt so much from the show, it feels that I must give back the right things.  1. Avoid giving a statement about the next statement before speaking it. For eg: If you are saying something digressive, just say it rather than saying - I would digress now, then saying the actual sentence. Another example being - when you are saying something lighter, just say it.      If you want to amend/tone down the statement that you are about to say, that should be a part of the statement itself. For example, if  I want to say something that might be offensive, I can say the same thing in a different manner and lighter words.   2. It's a good idea to use synonyms of words that are often being used - example - tangent , tangential. It brings novelty and doesn't take away the attention of the listener. Some synonyms for tangential - digressive, divergent, extraneous etc.     Another important point is that for slightly differing feelings, you would have the choice to use a different word.  3. It would be great if you can work on English learning. Since you are in the profession of communication, the better the instrument of communication, the easier/swifter it is to translate your thoughts/feelings into words.      I understand that the focus might be on the content and the guests, but the medium also matters.",1,0

Ranveer's podcast is watched by young audience and unfortunately the young audience is horribly unaware of what is going on in this country because of cajoling type of journalism and podcasts such as this. Ask some serious and smart questions, challenge him on few issues. J Sai Deepak has the potential to be a serious youth leader and hence his mettle should be tested before the youth starts look upto him. I have been following J Sai's media appearances and only a few times he has been asked uncomfortable questions. His conviction about his area of interest is admirable.",0,2

He never criticized his bother publically for selling their party to CONgress for the tourism ministry. He is not serious about real problems. He is not a seasonal politician. He just makes some noise every 4-5 months. He was a far left-leaning person who suddenly shifted to the Indic wing when he was supported by BJP to consolidate Kapu caste votes. He organized 10-15 Kapu caste meetings so far. Always talks about equality but asks Kapu people to vote for him only so that a Kapu(him) can become a CM.  He has no vision for the development of the state or the Indic Renaissance. At least he never proposed of that sort.,2,3

AND the episode didnt disappoint. Kudos to Ranveer for having chosen (even simplified it with Koffee with Karan types rapid fire in the middle segment) questions that provided an light hearted, easy, interesting, casual and diverse experience for viewers. Since Sai Deepak has already done many brilliant, detailed interviews on specific issues with many other channels (eg. Brown pundit Browncast), who have done a very good job of nuanced and in-depth research in their respective topics. It was refreshing to hear Sai Deepak answer such interesting and easy questions. This is TRS genre, and he delivered on it. Several amazing insights and takeaways in Sais answers. So many Indian public figures that I hadnt heard of previously, that I will go back and read more about. Enriching conversation. Hope Ranveer does many more episodes with Sai Deepak!  P.S - I expected Ranveer to be a bit more star struck and intimidated by Sai, but he didnt look like it at all! Either he is woefully unaware of how brilliant Sai can get with his answers, and hasnt watched that much in depth, or hes really really good with managing the pressure.",83,1

Shiva has propounded 108 ways of realization,  which he personally experience himself all the time. at any moment of time.  which means Hinduism has 108 different ways with which one can realize.  Buddha has used one out 108 to get himself realized and he marketed it well.  He described it scientifically step by step so that you know where you are - but it is a very long process and may take many life times.  Shiva is not bothered about marketing you got to do it for him - he is all encompassing.  No where comparable.  The last word is Buddha is just a small extension of Shiva, he didn't find anything new than what Shiva has propounded.   Shiva is the only God without parentage, No one knows where he comes from, neither he has a grave.   He was neither Human.

However, I would have liked Ranveer to dig deeper into some of the threads regarding Hindu Muslim relationships. I felt like ranveer sort of got scared of the path the conversation was taking and feared polarizing his audience. When in reality any honest conversation can polarize people. Thats not the intent but the truth and facts can be bitter and hard to digest. If Ranveer wants to be seen a thought leader that converses with thought leaders, Id encourage him to be fearless and go all in. In the name of morale, Ranveer backed away from having a tough honest conversation. JSD was under utilized in this podcast. His conversation with Smita Prakash on ANI was hard hitting. Not this.",0,0

A) he speaks the truth B) india got divided into two classes when Nehru an elite, took over who had no connection to the rural india and chose to deal with colonial shame by becoming one of them.  So then the branch of whos who and elite circle began. And the rural were out of it. Rather anyone too Indic was out of it. At this point, the rural are rising and they dont have anyone speaking their truth in as good English as J Sai Deepak as that place had always been reserved by the other class. Thus, they see a saviour, someone standing up for them, who can speak the language of the coloniser as well as the urban elite and still choose to stand for the Vedic culture.   Basically, underneath it all is shame. Colonial shame. Also known as ancestral trauma, collective trauma. We just chose different ways to deal with it.",2,0

Call anyone of them it will be a treat,I promise.

Refugees are refugees why to discriminate among them on the basis of religion is like labelling one religion as sub standard   U have no reason to trust pakistani muslim Or bangladesii muslim so why are u allowing them citizenship after 11 years also... Those hindus, jain etc fro whom u advocate 5 years period also choose to live there after partition and rejcted o choose india for various reasons...if we go by your logic only...  Dnt u think he contradicts himself..   The reason of nationwide protest also differed like the diversity of india  1) Northeast indians belived it will lead to influx of migrants (as those states are already going through refugee crisis)   2) the gov also pushed protest as ministers advertised CAA in context of nation wide NRC which would have really affected all indians including Indian Muslims  I too believe in j sai some logic and explaination... Just bcz someone is famous dnt follow them blindly..  I am also adv at SC ..  So just believe ki haan voh vaha practice krta hai English bolta hai toh sab sahi hi kah rha hoga...

8381,2023-05-06T02:54:08Z,@rameshshinde1193,"I would have agreed with this guy, he articulates quite well. But again, the problem is he is not neutral in his perspective. That means he does not criticize hindus as much as he criticizes muslims. Because he considers himself stauch hindu, he is easily biased towards hindu. Kyu bhai, hindu konse grah se aye hai jo unme koi negative baatein nahi hai? Nobody is innocent. Even historically we hindus have helped both muslim rulers and british rulers. As a history buff, I can tell you many examples of how hindu merchants and traders lent money to both muslim rulers and british rulers including East India Company for war expenditure. And even today, hindus typically look for profits and scam other fellow hindus. This is not a problem of hinduism. This is the problem of selfishness ingrained in human behaviour. So, don't make it a hindu vs muslim debate. Rather treat every action as a part of human behaviour.",1,4

Also in todays scenario, most of the elite and urbanized so called educated fraternities including NRIs are modi fans. I have seen many people belong to small town or villages talk more sensibly and human way than the urban elite classes. Also if you think logically todays government is actually anti Hindu, not only that, they are anti people belong to any community. In India, as a Hindu majority country, starting from 2014 due to  wrong economic policies, joblessness, Covid, inflation, several protests including farmers, students, wrestlers and many others what we even dont get news, most of the people who actually get suffered are HINDUs. Do you still believe the present Govt is pro-Hindu? For them hatred against a certain community is tagged as hinduttyo, which is nothing but a brainwashing tactics. They are basically fooling around the citizens, irrespective of any religion.",0,1

The reason for this is Congis and Commies who were in charge of education since 1947 and they made sure hindu heritage education was not permitted and is still not allowed. There are thousands of Christian and Muslim schools and colleges but hardly any hindu education establishments. Why?  Buddha was born in a Hindu family. His ideals were very similar to Jainism. When you look at idols of Buddha and the 24th Tirthankar it is very difficult to make out whether it is Buddha or Mahavir Bhagwan.,1,0

Being a good listener and open to ideas that may be opposite to your own is a huge part of being a good host. I had gathered you have more left bent thoughts after watching several of your videos and conversations where you reveal a lot of your personality through your body language and words, so i was skeptical towards how open you'd be to him as a guest and his thoughts. I am pleasantly surprised that you were open to listening and imbibing new perspectives which might be diametrically opposed to you and your left friends. Knowledge is key.

I felt this episode was only an ice breaker and shallow w.r.t what Sai Deepak can enlighten at large on topics that are Indic or Bhartiya centric as well as related contemporary affairs. I understand the probable  predicaments that you may be dealing with when it comes to hosting or having a strong and candidly opinionated personality like J Sai Deepak on your podcast.    Hope to see/hear many more deeper , distilled,curated as well as dedicated subject/topic that you take with Deepak at length.

Ranveer seemed less prepared and couldnt bring the best out of JSD.  2. Not only less prepared but also a bit rattled and nervous which he was trying to over compensate with a bit of casual coolness.  3. All in all I guess he was just not ready to take in the knowledge or information JDS brings to the table. Hence, he kept floating on the surface.  4. The sad part is that he didnt even realise what he could have done with these 1 n half hours.  5. Unlike others I dont want him to invite JDS again coz I m sure he wont be able to do justice then as well as he didnt have it in him to squeeze information from JDS.   I dont want to discourage Ranveer here. Just saying what I felt. It can be only me. But thats my take. Would love to see people agreeing with me. If not then probably I m mistaken.   Cheers",2,1

All the judgement which he made can be true or oneside because that's how he perceived it when he was in a situation.   Try to identify yourself as a human and inculcate the basic values of humanity. Don't divide or group yourself into caste, creed or religion. These create groups and when one tries to do the wrong or right thing, the whole  group is targeted. In retaliation the same group fight against another group.  Take everything with a pinch of salt. Try to be curious on things that are being shared by someone. Try to research by yourself. Be curious to question. This will open up a new dimension to look and approach different things.",1,1

Having been living in UP for 5+ years, I've seen the difference he is talking about, how every district in UP has something or the other to offer in terms of art, agricultural products, artisans, educational institutes, etc. and MP is doing wonders when it comes to agriculture, but Bihar is still lacking due to the politics in play here otherwise we do have all the resources required to contribute a lot more than what we do now.  If India ever wants to lead the manufacturing domain, it can't be without the human resources these states offer.

It doesn't apply to Muslims or other religious groups, just Christians and Jews. It's always been in place! No one has an issue with it. Also, as all know israel gives citizenship to ANY JEWISH person in the world, ANYWHERE, even if there is no persecution or anything, no reason required,  you get it because you are jewish. it's a safe haven for jews! And that's no issue at all either. So why is there such a big problem with Indias CAA?! Also, CAA is NOT selective to Hindus. It includes Sikhs and Christians as well. (Buddhists and Jains I consider sects of Hinduism anyway, so not mentioning them). What's the big deal about CAA?! Also india is the only country that can protect the oldest religion and oldest living civilization in the world! Why shouldn't it safeguard Hindus from around the world! When US and Israel can do it proudly, why not india! I fail to understand. Can someone explain?",2,0

Sai, UP is not only about Noida & Ghaziabad, the police are  still not really approachable, on the context of law & order you all must be aware of Atiq Ahmad's murder in front of police and the police are incapable of firing a single bullet, before that Atiq Ahmad also killed a witness against him, Noida is developed because many good companies are located there & it's not like that Noida is developed after 2016, it is a good city since Mayawati's govt., Roads are getting better since independence but if I talk about my city local roads are worse, and potholes and a bad drainage system are still issues, none of the govt has really changed the UP the way it should have, we still face 2,3 days power cutoffs in killing summer, basic needs like govt hospitals & schools are ignored and are in bad condition. Sorry, but it is clearly visible that J Sai is biased. And it should be remembered that in a country like India, constant progress is never gonna stop, it is like things getting better with time so the basic progress of a country should not be counted as an achievement of a govt.",1,0

CAA is NOT for Indian Muslims but safety and welfare of Indian civilization so we do not go down the path of Pakistan's economy 2. Pro and Anti Modi people both are half right 3. People make opinion on the basis of the crowd and media and lack of research that becomes the problem of human minds and arguments in the country  4. His top 5 priorities if he becomes a PM (MANIFESTING)  5. Benefits of removing the temples from state control and what is happening behind our backs with the money we donate to temples - a huge shocking racket of our beloved culture. 6. Western and Indian Narrative about Bharat 7. Bharat/Hindu state is more about safeguarding our identity for a better cultural boom that keeps human touch alive so that we do not become a materialistic state like that of Europe or the USA. 8. The ways in which Modi is behind as a leader 9. How UP has turned over in terms of overall development because of the great Yogi Adityanath How MP, UP AND Bihar, the most stereotyped states are full of high IQ and rich resources, which if tapped rightly, can turn the face of Bharat. 10. Why and how are the Indians coming back from abroad to live here and make their career in Bharat.",0,0

The same Hindus who have voted BJP to power are being left out after they won the elections in many parts of India just for economic benefit. But at the end of the day we have no choice but to vote bjp as i cant imagine the situation of Hindus when leftists communists minded people will come to power.,1,0

10462,2023-05-05T17:49:58Z,@anugrahshrivastava1819,"I'm a big big fan of yours Ranveer. I've heard a good number of your podcasts. And the issue I personally wish to highlight is related to a statement you made in the latest Abhijit chavda episode (you've also said this multiple times ik), which is, that you adhere to centrism and like to hear both sides, which you also feel is the duty of someone in your role. Now, ik it is borderline impossible to be completely unbiased. But, I would urge you to kindly go through your podcasts playlist once and categorize your guests on one of the sides (the left or the right wing). I am not very aware of the Hindi playlist, but if you do this for the English podcast, I'm sure you will find that the majority of your guests adhere somewhat at least to the right wing's ideology. And I have no problem with that but for your statement that you try to be neutral. If you adhere to the centrist ideology and wish to listen to both sides of the coin, I'm sorry but you need to seriously introspect my friend in relation to your guest list. And I often hear you saying in the podcast that your guests are invited on the basis of public demand. Bro, you've largely gathered a rightist audience. They are naturally likely to demand people whose ideology they like or adhere to. So, if you truly wish to hear both sides' points of view, you might have to go against your audience's demand. This is counterintuitive to a content creator ik, but as of now, you are a content creator who also deals with discussions related to ideologies and intellect. And you may have to go against your instinct as a content creator in order to form a better space to put forward ideological arguments. I sincerely appreciate your efforts and truly believe you are exceptional. Wish you the best and hope you will take my criticism in a constructive manner.",0,0

They are so so relatable to reality,facts n spirituality.  As I am a spiritual  person,yet very practical who believes in facts,I am really happy n impressed that u select such interesting and deep topics, which I always wanted to know about, n was never convinced with other answers, till I met ur podcasts  .  Now regarding  Mr sai ,I was always impressed about his intellectual and factual talks while randomly watching  reels. After watching this podcast my many questions have got their  answer's.  Thank u so much for influencing us all in the right direction, u r not biased,but u speak from the heart n ur own experiences which is really the truth every one goes through but fear to speak or understand   Stay Blessed Always and keep doing the great work.

They don't focus on the high rates of unemployment, disparity between rich and poor etc. And their anchors are also top class in provoking people. The likes of Rajat Sharma (India TV), Sudhir Chaudhary, (Zee News), Amish Devgan (News18), Rubika Liaquat (ABP News), Arnab Goswami (Republic TV) are always ready to poke Muslim leaders, Christian leader and to some extent some Sikh leaders.",1,0

Drugs were used to make them believe that whatever they were doing was absolutely justified. Muslims are paid huge sums of money for this.

By the way, there are already plenty of platforms available for people to consume politics, and it can/is messy. Let's not bring that mess here.

We have seen what happened in past 1000 years of Islamic & Christian rule over us. We hindus are doomed to repeat our mistakes. This time, the situation is worse and we can't let the history repeat. No Govt. will come for your protection. The demography is changing rapidly. Look around you, West Bengal and Kerala already gone and on the path to becoming Islamic states. The neighboring states to follow. Rampant HIndu migration form these states is already in place. Form local groups, keep your community, mohalla informed of any such activities like, illegal majaars, butcher shops, any illegal M@slim ghettos emerging around your area. This is a systematic plan of encroaching areas around HIndus and then create chaos and riots forcing them to migrate. Currently, The lower middle class is facing the brunt. Don't think you have climbed up the social ladder and since you are living behind gated community, it will protect you. We are talking about 150 million uneducated  & radicalised jihadis. I still consider the other 70 million Muslims still not radicalised yet. WAKE UP!",2,0
