1,2023-12-14T14:21:41Z,@kampoengbatoe2699,"India is a developed country, and by 2024 will take over the US as the world number 1 superpower. The whole country (literally all cities, towns and villages) are vastly clean, modern and futuristic, with zero crime rate and absolutely zero pollution. Its capital New Delhi is well known as the cleanest city on earth. There are no slumps, shit-holes, ghettos or poor uneducated hungry people in any corner of India. Each and every Indian is dead honest - no need to worry if you drop wallet on the street, they will always return it to you untouched. India is totally free of beggars, thieves, scammers, thugs, mafia and gangsters. Its government is very clean, corruption-free and has consistently achieved zero unemployment for decades. Public transportation and infrastructure is always no.1 in the world. Public safety is way better than even country like Japan - very very safe for women to walk alone at night anywhere in India. Indian police force is remarkably professional, corruption-free and humane - they don't take bribes, they don't extort money, they don't protect scammers or organized crime, they don't rape male and female inmates inside prison cells, or beat ordinary citizens on the streets brutally with batons or long rods (like what you usually see on youtube). And at least half of Indian population (about 700 millions) are totally committed to support climate change by having a strong habit of pooing everywhere anywhere in open space everyday (not in toilets, there is no toilet anyway) to fertilize soil naturally and save water (no need to flush anyway, right?). Such amazing and fantastic achievements by Modi and his BJP in making India the world most developed country. Bravo Bravo Bravo.",0,0

Take for ex production of bad quality food items such as bread made using feet or sweets made using adulterated milk and whatnot else or in extreme cases plastic rice/egg, mediocre medicine will add to GDP and so will the concomitant healthcare cost that one will be subjected to after consuming those substandard quality food items. This hapoens in 3rd world.   Qualitative economy -where goods and services produced in an economy are of good quality, should take precedence over quantitative economy. This is where the 1st world countries with least corruption(western countries, europe, japan etc) outshine the 3rd world overpopulated and mostly corrupt countries(india, pakistan, bangladesh etc) So a country with smaller gdp need not be intimidated by these big nos as long as it is providing quality goods and food items to its citizen and exporting the same to the others.  Afterall what good it is eating those breads made with someone else's feet, infused with sweat & spit. or having chickens that feed on gutter material as opposed to chikens raised on farmland , or having plastic eggs after every workout.

124,2023-11-19T12:40:10Z,@JohnsonDang67,"Why India want to compare with China? India should improve there own country and improve India citizens life. Since India like to compare China why not compare China successful bring out China citizens out of poverty? Don't compare economy although India economy are far back away from China. Compare citizens buying power. Do you know why Apple and many luxury western company don't want leave China? Compare with India how many western luxury company in India? This means what? China citizens leave out of poverty but for India citizens mostly leave in poverty. Why not compare this? Many India citizens got no Clean Water to drink. Public toilets are very very very less. Don't forget back to 30 to 40yrs ago India economy are much better then China not only economy even technology like space program and automobile but today India are far far far back away from China. India Modi always want to be world manufacturing and China are going to become invention just like western countries. Many China factory move to third countries to manufacture and India one of the countries. China don't mind India become world manufacturing because China want to build own brand and products manufacture local or others countries. China construction are become stronger and stronger. China got many Mega Construction around the world and how about India? Simple bridge build twice is twice still can collapse do you know why? Not India engineering poor is Corruption terrible. There don't care India citizens life the bridge collapse there care about how much money there can get. Japan help India build high speed railway and till today how many kilometres had been built? Japan problems? No is India internal problems. India build it own high speed train actually is not considered high speed train because international standard high speed train is 250km and India below 200lm yet not run smoothly got many accidents. Why? Many India citizens can't afford take high speed train do you know that? Not like China every China citizens afford take high speed train. How good India economy doesn't me mean India citizens life becomes better. The rich become more rich and poor become more and more poor. Although India economy already pass UK but UK citizens leave better then India citizens. So India earn so much where to go? Guess yourself. One more things India should stop Talk Big it make others countries laugh at India. Like when China first build own super carrier India Modi come out said India will build lager and advance then China at the end India took 17yrs to build and not bigger or advance then China because China already build 2nd super carrier much much bigger and advance with electronic ejection and how about India? Don't forget India carrier advance electronic mostly buy from western countries not like China mostly build it own. China continues build 3rd, 4th, 5th and so on Modi already keep quiet not said anything make whole world laugh. China build own space station Modi also come out said India will build own space station but need to wait till 2030 come on carrier took 17yrs to build and space station much difficulties do you think can complete on 2030? China successful land on moon and bring back samples from moon few years back and India just successful landed on moon and failed bring back samples from moon. China successful landed on Mars as well and India not at all. So just keep quiet successful only come out talk just like China successful only show out just like Space Station, Huawei mobile Mate 60 Pro, Stealth fighter jet and so on. Keep quiet and do not just talk. India so great full about India and why not speak more Tamil instead English. India government mostly speak English and not Tamil and mostly mix with Tamil and English. That's why India English got a very strong Tamil pronunciation. So you see Italy, Japan, Korea, and many countries including China got speak English in International media or meeting? All use translator because there love own language not like India mouth said love India but body tell them admire UK. The worst part is India people's can speak English consider high class people's and can't speak English are low class people's. Mean what? India speak India all are low class people's? India rape crimes are very very high not only women's also girls under age as well and very very very serious. Women's and girls walk alone on the state very very very dangerous. Don't tell me not. Many India movies also shows as well. What India government did?",1,1

In my view the success is mainly due to the fact that China has made ruthless changes to its ancient beliefs and policies over the centuries.  Since India is also an ancient civilization, I believe that India should also make surgical changes to its ancient beliefs. What India needed since its independence from the British is a Mao type leader who is not afraid to make revolutionary changes whether the majority of Indians like them or not eg  cows roaming freely in the streets, the caste system, people swimming in the dirty Ganges etc etc.  I have the greatest respect for Mao and his comrades who nationalized all government own land since the 1950's.  Today China can build infrastructure any where it deems fit.  That is the reason why China has so many modern infrastructures that are the envy of the world.",0,3

With the same population of 1.4 billion, India has been independent for so long, has better land, and a better international environment, but now it is still wallowing in cow shit. The Western system is not suitable for countries with large populations. A population of tens of millions is already the upper limit of the Western system's governance capabilities. This is determined by the change in population from quantitative to qualitative changes. The United States, with a population of 300 million, is already facing the collapse of grassroots governance.

The De-Dollarization process has started, dropping value of USD which will push up US domestic inflation.  By the way, if US can print money to support its economy, why cant China? If there is an economy down turn, China has 800 billion USD foreign reserves and gold, which can support it to print more money to ease the down turn.  India will grow due to domestic consumption, but lack of industrialisation and ability to export, India wont accumulate foreign reserves as much as they wish. Weak Rupee can not sustain domestic consumption due to imported inflation.   Furthermore, India is not in the position to print more money to support Domestic consumption growth like US or China.

Xi will no longer be the leader of China within 5 years.   China has always been a bully. How do you get a bully to stand down?? NOT Appeasement. Appeasement only encourages Bullies to bully more!. India needs to abandon its pretense of neutrality to deal effectively with China 1. Quit BRICS - the world's two biggest bullies (Russia and China) are members of BRICS. The USA understands it made a huge mistake supporting Pakistan vs India. One of the key advantages is being a democracy is that you can freely discuss your mistakes and correct them.  2. Create a separate trading association comprised of democracies-only, facilitated by India. 3. Create an defense pact (on par with NATO) to deal effectively with China - India, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam.

This is an illusion. When your country's per capita GDP is only more than 2,000 US dollars, economic development is very easy. Just build infrastructure without thinking. When the per capita GDP reaches 5,000 US dollars, you need to develop better industries and ensure that you All the products can be sold, and the profits will be reinvested in the industry to form a positive cycle. When you reach this stage, you will find that many countries have begun to focus on you and slowly start to cause you all kinds of troubles. .... If you overcome these through hard work and the per capita GDP reaches about 10,000 US dollars, then you need to develop internationally competitive brands and leading technologies. Most countries will not  be able to do so at this stage. Reaching the peak, the phenomenon of deindustrialization occurred, and the economy began to decline or even collapse, and then it continued in an infinite cycle below 10,000 US dollars... At this stage, in addition to domestic problems, the pressure from foreign forces also began to erupt. It began to intensify and cooperated with domestic opposition forces, separatist forces, pro-foreign forces, etc., causing domestic political turmoil. This turmoil accelerated the economic decline, and then international public opinion, even military intervention, and the withdrawal of international capital Domestic capital fled in large quantities, and the result was that domestic asset prices plummeted. Then international capital re-entered through this channel to buy the assets after the collapse, and became the actual controller. The final result was that all the wealth of the country was looted, and eventually Becoming a slave of foreign capital forever, this story has been repeated around the world after World War II... There is a Korean movie that tells how South Korea was plundered by international capital during the Asian economic crisis in the 1990s. In the story, the major shareholders of the top ten companies became foreigners overnight.... The impact continues to this day....For example, Samsung Group, you think it's a Korean company? In fact Samsung's major shareholder is Wall Street capital, and most of Samsung's dividends are actually given to Wall Street....  By then you will find out what the real purpose of the United States and the West is in constantly promoting the issue of \""democracy\"".

There are no slumps, shit-holes, ghettos or poor uneducated hungry people in any corner of India. Each and every Indian is well educated, dead honest, equally wealthy and prosperous. Its democratic government is immensely effective, totally clean and corruption-free -- proven by the country's consistent zero unemployment for decades. Its police force holds the reputation of having the highest global standards of integrity, is very clean, corruption-free, humane, competent and professional in their jobs - they don't take bribes, they don't extort money, they don't protect scammers or organized crime, they don't rape young women or beat ordinary citizens brutally on the streets with batons or long rods like what you usually see in bollywood movies. Its judiciary system has stellar track records where judges had solved and closed all legal cases as quickly as the blink of an eye. Public utilities, public transportation, public education and notably its public toilets are all ranked first in the world. And, in case you're not aware of yet, India proudly has the world largest public toilet freely available for everyone - the Ganga River, where people can conveniently take a bath, pee and poop at the same time in one go.

Chinese government invested 25 times the amount of what Indian government invest in scientific research and development.

Most of the labour workers has taken no formal training and they join workforce just as a labourer where they do what they asked for. For example: building a house. In other countries, a person has to get certificate before starting as a carpenter. But in India, theres nothing like that. This is just one example. So most of the work is done with poor finish here. You see how people design bridges and roads in semi metro cities. It is very poor.   2. Corruption is another issue where everyone from politicians to contractors, everyone has their share. Result, money is not utilised. I feel bad about it. We call our country Bharat Mata (mother India), but we treat it worst compared to any other country. Throw garbage wherever you want, spit, keep making same road again and again and waste natural resources.   3. People want to do government jobs only where they can get pay, pay rise every year without doing anything. I have literally seen it people staying at hone and earrings much much more than a normal person doing private job. People has this mindset to somehow get into govt job and secure future.   4. People thinks that if my countrys GDP is increasing than we are superpower. Nope, were still third world country unless and until a common man has a happy life where they have good public transport, free water, clean air and places, and organised development.   4. I feel bad when I see people voting based on caste and specifically states like UP and Bihar which are one of the most poorest, corrupt, far under performing and financially burdened states for our country.   We compare ourselves to china, but we lack basic antiquates and skills in which Chinese people are ahead and thats the reason they are far superior. I said everything because I live abroad and when I come here back for visiting my country, I can feel whats wrong.

But will it have exponential growth from 2030-2070? Probably not. Goldmans Sachs are working with incomplete data, and the future is impossible to predict. So will India have higher quality goods and more exports? Yes, but to which degree depends largely on the political leadership and the cultural willingness to adapt to new modes of living.   As a side note, I would just like to add that this video uses outdated and selective data for digital adoption and manufactured goods. I'm sure the video creator has a good reason for doing this in telling his story, but you can easily find a more complete picture yourself if you look up Digital Adoption Index or Industrial Production Index (a many more datasets that go deeper from macro to microeconomics). And just as young demographics can be both a blessing and a curse depending on the education and healthcare capabilities of the country, so too can specialization and diversification both lead to boom-bust cycles and stagnation. Specialization in a handful of sectors can be a viable strategy, to a certain extent, just not only in one or two so that a market crash destroys the national economy (see Greece with tourism+shipping or Iceland with financial services).",0,0

The role of India and its reliance upon the West during the years since it got its supposed independence, has it today just as helpless and dependent as it was when it first got its independence. Whereas in China, the chinese fought for their independence. They became militant right from the outstart, and today even though they are not loved by the West, but they are respected by the West. Now the West don't respect India, but they do love India.

Though India is growing and has the potential, but couldnt achieve it because of lacking Human Capital development. HDI cannot be improved unless the state sponsored education standards are improved. But these politicians will never allow it to happen. As most of the private education institutions are owned or run by the kith and kins of these very politicians. Out of the 2.9% of GDP spent on education, I think over 2% is spent on the premier institutes like IITs and IIMs and hardly 0.9% is probably used on primary / secondary schooling. Irony is that until recently a large portion of these pupils graduating from state subsidised premier institutes (except medicine) find opportunities outside India because of the fat pay checks.
