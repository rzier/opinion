(1) Mobile internet became widespread and the country moved towards a digital era, now having the cheapest data rates per GB in the world. Internet penetration increased from 7.5% in 2010 to 60% in 2022. (2) Trains and Railway stations were modernized. Now there are semi-high speed trains and airport-like stations. Then only 2 cities had metro/subway, now 15 cities have a metro/mrts system. (3) In 2010 only 35% of the population had access to a toilet, now in 2022 more than 99% of the population has access to it. (4) India ranked 27 in Crime Index in 2012, now in 2022 it has dropped to 79 with public safety being improved day by day.  All these data are available online. It takes a broad and unprejudiced mind to learn about the current state.",1,3

This means, India is back in a situation to be called a country of mass poverty after 45 years.

All the estimated new poor due to the pandemic is in addition to this\""   498 Million Indians live in abject poverty yet India thinks it's Germany or the US. India needs a reality check.

Nothing but an illusion.   \""India is the No. 1 country in the world for open defecation, with over 344 million people without regular access to toilets in the country, according to 2017 statistics from the World Health Organization and UNICEF.   Hundreds of millions of people in the country end up defecating outside, which can spread diseases including cholera, typhoid and COVID-19.Poor sanitationin India leads to over 126,000 deaths every year from diarrheal diseases\""   India isn't a Super Power but it is and always will be the Super Pooper of the world!",2,1
