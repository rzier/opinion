It should adopt English as the official language, like Singapore. No shame in doing that. Culture? The Chinese like to venture and start their own...... Ten Cents and Ali Babas and Hwawei. Indians preferred to work for Microsoft and Google. Entrepreneurship is more common in Chinese culture. Lastly, the democratic process is also slowing India down. Too many opinions and ideas.",0,0

42,2023-11-25T15:50:59Z,@tincoffin,Colonisation has nothing to do with it. 1757 was the start of the Industrial revolution which the cause of India's decline. What he cannot explain is how Germany and Japan rose to become great powers without having empires... Empires are the consequence of power not the cause.They do not become powerful by exploiting colonies. India was the Jewel in the Crown for Britain because of the vast political power it gave not because of the economic benefits which as many realised at the time were very doubtful. The rise of China in the last twenty years is no mystery. It was able to exploit for the first time for hundreds of years what in the industrial era was a massive disadvantage and this was in the same era equally true of India. - its vast static agrarian population. For these countries industrialisation had been a positive disadvantage. It was cheaper and better to employ the excess labour market and not cause unemployment  than import expensive foreign machines. Catch 22. India has been poor in the industrial era because everything has been against it till now.  No amount of tinkering with different governments or different economic theories would have made it any different.,2,1

Although it is known as one of the four ancient civilizations, the quality of its civilization is very low, and it remains so to this day. This determines that India's national development can only be difficult. In fact, Westerners do not want to see a developed India emerge, because a China has already made the West very anxious. But the West needs India to contain China, so it continues to promote India's so-called advantages to cater to India's self-beautiful illusions. On the other hand, the West has used its advantage in public opinion to vilify, suppress or belittle China's culture and history. They would rather see a divided China that is not such a threat to the West. For example, on the Tibet issue, the West and India have found a G point for cooperation. They ignore the reality that Tibet has been owned by China since the Ming and Qing dynasties, refuse to recognize the good development of Tibet today, and even ignore the Dalai Lama's own position. They forcibly fabricate the claim that Tibet is an independent country in an attempt to politically vilify China and disrupt China's development. In this process, Indians are also happy to be a good and loyal dog to the West. Indians lack the political wisdom to govern the country and are more suitable to be compared with Africa. In the foreseeable future, India may remain poor and have no hope of development.",0,1

Its interesting how you started the video stating that money was used originally as a unifying totem or aspirational concept as legitimacy and support to form a government.  That really provides a fascinating context for the time period.  As communism aimed to abolish money and unify the Soviet Union under socialist principles, India started out as a way to make money, more or less for Britain and the Raj exclusively.  So there is a wariness in India to relying too heavily on foreign support. Thats probably what convinced them to try communism.  But not embracing globalisation might be a result of just the fact that India is relatively new in terms of its overall organisation of infrastructure. So many people and so much space is a challenge to organise.  The spinning wheel on the flag represents Ghandis spinning wheel and refusing to pay tax on hand made goods to the British in order to support self reliance.  A command economy is only as good as the system in place is well designed and executed.  Because it is not always successful, does not mean it is fundamentally unworkable as a concept.  The world is not that simple. Also money does not bring happiness.  A rapid westernisation is simply window dressing. Ireland has some tax revenue from large tech companies but it barely effects most people. Water used to be free in Ireland.  So you said yourself, the USSR used free stuff to be popular and socialism and India eventually went capitalist and embraced individualism.  So in the west free and liberal means individual and not responsible for others. Liberty, egality, but not fraternity.  But what is the indian nature? What is the priority of India? Is it social responsibility or is it fiscal responsibility? Because they are not necessarily related.",0,0

612,2023-07-07T12:24:31Z,@tropicalbeach9225,"These are good points and insights but there are far more issues a large. One of them being that besides India being so corrupt and socially controlled by the government and elites by stealing all the resources and money for themselves. Another thing that was failed to be mentioned in this video was that India is one of the most illiterate, uneducated and backward countries in the world. You need education, skill and knowledge to build, expand, develop, and manipulate technology all which india and indians failed to do because they didnt have a proper organized system to educate its people. There are too many people in India who are illiterate and uneducated. India was a more selfish culture instead of working together for the common good ( like many Europeans and Chinese did) most Indians were against each other, didnt want to work together and out for their own interests ( this is detrimental to society and its development). From the outside world they view indians are inferior, lazy, not that smart, and living in another century. It is kind of bizarre because India at one time was richer than China in natural resources and China was also invaded and had more population that India at the time and still developed like crazy and now makes the west look 2nd class. This is probably why many countries in modern day history still have a skewed and bad impression of India due to its history and failure to develop. Sometimes, I wonder if Communism would have been better for India instead of capitalism!  Also too, I find it very weird on how indians were easly manipulated and taken advantage of by the British because some bengali contacted the East British railroad company for help and all of a sudden all these british came in and Indians allowed it? They never thought about developing weapons or fighting skills to protect their country, people, and borders? I guess this proves that many indians felt inferior or subordinate to the White man?? I mean you can say guests were like Gods.. but these were not guests!!! They were invaders!! A guest would have to be invited! Nobody invited the whole british colony into India!  India has potential and will develop more with time. However, I never see India reaching the status of say China or USA. Just not possible. If India ever becomes #1 in the world beating China and USA then it will be a miracle and it would be like winning the lottery!

While corruption occurs in a lot of countries, India's corruption levels compared to the size of their economy was on the high end of the scale.   If you look at the poorest countries in the world, most of them are marked for their gross corruption levels, and corruption is misallocated investment.  Also, you might want to tap the brakes on the Chinese economy.   Investment lead economies at some point need to transition to consumption based economies, and it is a tough transition.

Coming to the straightforward answer, corruption, laziness of ppl, lack of civic sense and socialist policies. India as a society need to pull up its socks and start working hard. No excuses.   Now the complex answer, its not easy to govern india. Indias problem is very very unique - diversity. In no other country would you find such a diverse population. We Indians have hundreds of criteria to divide ourselves. Religion, caste, social classes, linguistic divisions, etc etc. youd find cultures differing every few hundred kilometres.  So making laws which wont offend anyone and benefits everyone is quite a difficult task and enforcing it is even more difficult. Youd find someone protesting against every law.  And this gives rise to votebank politics and appeasement politics for the sake of winning elections.  You could give me the example of china, which was similar to india when we started, but you have to understand that china had to compromise on democratic values for the remarkable growth. Dissent is totally crushed there.  The west, diversity has been encouraged once they have become rich and developed. And the immigrants are expected to follow the law of the land. India isnt like that. Thats why it frustrated me when someone offers the china model or Japanese model of growth for india. No. India has unique problems, it requires unique solutions.",1,0

(1 billion times) Indians are strong and intelligent from far, but when you get to interact with them, nope. Not because they cannot be, but because instead of taking things in their own hands and find their own development path, they fixated all their hopes on the West. \"" we are a democracy, then the West developed China instead of developing us.... The West developed Hongkongand Macao...\"" I believe that's why India sounds like it suppprts Taiwan independence b4cause India thinks that coupd be too much of China amd Taiwan reunifies. But the prob is, this is counter to India's own policy pf non session of its claimed territory. So India has double standards. The West should bring \""factories and FDIs here because we share democratic values and ...\""  Mr India, there is some you got wrong: the US doesn't care about democracy, it cares about national interests. That means if democracy doesn't benefit the US, it will still attack you and destroy you, regardless even of your skin color (Yugoslavia is an example). So instead of crying to the wolves, come up with your own strategy to develop because if you get developed by someone else (the West) it will be limited and controlled development,  and the West will destroy you whenever it wants to. In other words, you will be vassalized and controlled and made into a time bomb that can go off whenever the remote controller wants it to. That's exactly where Modi's India despite all the rhetoric, is headed to. Stop trying to think that the West will move its supply chain after of China just because you are a democracy. Another point is, China is already wealthy and it has high tech and many factories. It is for instance investing heavily in the Middle East, countries that has coffers full of petrodollars. In Africa, China has massive investments there, from education to high tech to service industry to factories. And the last point being, the West did not really develop China: it was a win win. China allowed the West to enjoy 30 years of wealthy living by giving them access to cheap goods while western corporations were paying low wages to Chinese. That's not how you develop people. Say, Chinese are smart enough and they could position themelselves well so that that western exploitation could benefit China too, period. Good luck with Modi",2,0

Oh please also put history video on where Netherland is in rocket science?  And also explain double Irish with Dutch sandwich tax avoidance techniques?  Indian companies like sharda crop and astec exporting seeds and fertilizers to Europe. Really ? You are saying India can't afford seeds and fertilizer?

Being racist is one thing but getting proper facts is another thing.  Ok you even mentioned kings ruling and everything. Dutch army lost to one of the Indian king (ruling a small state) and thats their decline in India after that they even left India and stayed in Indonesia and destroyed their economy.

The Huns owned most of Germany at some point. I do not want to relativize the brutal effects colonialism had onto so many humans, however the Brits did what most others were doing for all of history. They were just much better at it because they were one of the first to industrialize.  To blame colonialism for all issues today is also very interesting, because countries had 70 years to get their act together and form effective and good goverments. Some managed to do so, most did not. And where it worked wealth came relatively quickly. Look at Korea, Botswana, Taiwan.  To prove that it is all colonialisms fault you would have to prove that every singe bad government that followed and was accepted by the people to a degree that it was not removed by a new better government was the colonializers fault.",1,1

You do light briefly on it by pointing out the \""lack of innovation\"" in India. More specifically, Britain was able to make leaps and bound in the textile market that India had previously dominated, using new technology and human exploitation.   Recent research has demonstrated that the human cost of a basic capitalist mechanism (bankrupcy for inefficient producers) caused around 120 million deaths in India in just a few decades decade: a greater human cost than even the disasters of Mao and Stalin's reforms combined.

And just like every other developed country they are going to suffer from the 'baby boomers' reaching retirement. Within the next 30 to 40 years, China's population is predicted to shrink by around 30%.  This is less of a problem for say the UK who focuses on financial services etc. But what does China focus on? Manufacturing. Manufacturing makes up over 40% of the countries economic focus.

If Britishers are the reason why many countries are poorer then why non colonized countries like Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Liberia etc. are poorer than India? Why many colonized countries like America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand are one of the richest countries in the world.  India had 23% of world's GDP in 1750s only because it had 25% of world's population at that period. Countries like Britain, Netherland had 3 times the per capita of India even at that time. Looking at the per-capita, India was one of the poorest countries in the world even in 1750s. Most of the east Asian countries, Middle eastern countries, European countries had more per-capita than India in 18th century. Saying India was one of the richest countries in 17th century just because it had large share of GDP in the world is like saying at present India is richer than UK because India had more GDP than UK. We have to look at per-capita income to find which country is richer and which is not. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong had accepted British colonization brought more positives than negatives to them. Singapores first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, said that before the British arrived, there was no organized human society in Singapore, unless a fishing village can be called a society. Countries like Singapore are richer than India now because they had honest politicians like Lee Kuan Yew who don't unnecessarily blame Britishers and had the courage to accept the fact that colonialism brought more positives than negatives to them unlike Indian politicians.",5,5

We produce world class fibers in our Chinese sponsored heavy machinaries at significantly lower cost than India do. So they had adopted an anti dumping tax on our products in order to keep local elite jute mill owners happy. Indian citizen pay twice the price we do for these fiber made products or processed fiber itself. I could relate these bad policies after watching these videos. Now i understand why BD has matched India in terms of GDP per capita in recent years. BD has It's own problem too. Corruption is the reason why many Foreign companies have rejected their plan to invest. In order to start a foreign company to start business in BD the investors has to pay a lot of money as a bribe in order to get license. Both country could have been far prosperous with better and corruption free policies.

This is absurd on it's face and shows you know very little, not only about the USA history, but western civilization as well.  I am thinking that this is bc of your own tightly held world view and lack of understanding and curiosity in general.  The reasons the USA entered the wars they did are not simple - but it is certain that they cannot be boiled down to the one simplistic reason you give, money.  This tells me you have at least some ignorance and blindness to motives other than wealth.  I know that this video blog (vlog) is about poverty - but even poverty is not the sole result of material resource development and social organization.  Many comments here point out your blindness to internal corruption.  Why is that?  Having a reason for why you overlook the obvious would help you grow as a person.  Have you never seen up close and personal, an altruistic heart?  A heart that wants your good and will sacrifice their own for your sake?  Have you never met an authentic Christian?  What about Mother Theresa, or Billy Graham, or Hudson Taylor, or Mary Troyer, and the list goes on and on and on.  You even have the possibility of meeting Jesus the Christ, if you really wanted to.  I suppose that must be inconceivable to you?  Is money the only important thing to you?  2. You claim that men are not \""intelligent\"" enough to run a central government.  My response to you about this:  intelligence is not the only thing lacking here.  Just like there is way more to life that money, so too there is way more to a person than intelligence.

If Britishers are the reason why many countries are poorer then why non colonized countries like Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Liberia etc. are poorer than India? Why many colonized countries like America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand are one of the richest countries in the world.  India had 23% of world's GDP in 1750s only because it had 25% of world's population at that period. Countries like Britain, Netherland had 3 times the per capita of India even at that time. Looking at the per-capita, India was one of the poorest countries in the world even in 1750s. Most of the east Asian countries, Middle eastern countries, European countries had more per-capita than India in 18th century. Saying India was one of the richest countries in 17th century just because it had large share of GDP in the world is like saying at present India is richer than UK because India had more GDP than UK. We have to look at per-capita income to find which country is richer and which is not. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong had accepted British colonization brought more positives than negatives to them. Singapores first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, said that before the British arrived, there was no organized human society in Singapore, unless a fishing village can be called a society. Countries like Singapore are richer than India now because they had honest politicians like Lee Kuan Yew who don't unnecessarily blame Britishers and had the courage to accept the fact that colonialism brought more positives than negatives to them unlike Indian politicians.",4,2

The idea that the United States developed by forcing Latin American countries to open their markets is pure fantasy.  American trade with Latin America was a small part of American trade in the 19th century.  The United States had very little impact on Latin America.  American trade was primarily with Europe.    2. And Latin American industrialization during the Depression is absolute nonsense.    3. The assessment of the Soviet Union is also flawed.  The part about the brutality of the Soviet system (NKVD, the Terror, purges, the Gulag, Ukrainian Famine, left.) is also true.   And it is true that the Soviets industrialized, but the industry was growing in Russia even before the Revolution. Not only was Soviet industry a small fraction of the size of American industry, but the products produced in the Siviet Union were of very poor quality.  In addition, the Soviet factories were inefficient and unprofitable which is why they quickly went bankrupt after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of state support.  4. The assessment of the Indian economy after independence was more valuable.  One aspect missed was the almost Byzantine bureaucratic state.  But state restrictions on capitalism were a major factor limiting India's growth until the turn to market reforms -- i.e, capitalism  (1990s) leading to real market reforms. economic growth.",2,0

While also breaking nation into two parts and 3parts later.  And javaharlal and sardar patel both stood for election and patel won by 13-2 votes but still Gandhi gave PM seat to Nehru that was first and most important move which was non-democratic.  And that's where started the fall of independent india.  And since then former british led congress has been ruling india uptill 2014 recently nationalist government with Indian native representative led BJP won.  And india started to progress.

1447,2022-10-27T22:31:52Z,@tarjd6796,"To fellow Indians who are debating in the comments section and voicing their perpetual theories as to why India is still poor from a  socio-economical standpoint (disregarding those Indias who are still in denial about it all) - my question to you is:  What are you prepared to do about it?  And/or are you even aware as to how to deal with this problem head on?   For I can tell you without question that this isn't just up to the government - this is a \""people\"" problem (I.e you the people). To put it in other words dealing with poverty, the degraded infrastructure, poor sanitation and the lack of healthcare and education to those in rural areas must be managed and MUST change.  The most effective way that you can produce this change is by pushing your local politicians who represent your constituents or assemblies in parliament to enforce these changes, and keep pushing for these changes until the gov't is forced to act on them.  India is a democratic country, so as the masses who determine the outcome of elections you have the power and the  political tools to force change up the chain and you should seize the opportunity to utilise it (this is part of the democratic process and is how reforms and changes take place). India is not making any significant progress in their current socio-political climate because nobody is pressing hard enough the current party in power to commit to these reforms. Stop focusing on overt religious nationalism (which is being spewed at you by religious and nationalist fanatics who hold certain seats in authority, as it will achieve no long term gain), stop overspending on military arms (including an overspend on the army above and beyond other branches of the military whose expenditure can and should be shifted elsewhere) and stop supporting useless legislative acts and bills peddled by the gov't that in recent events have caused civil riots that have produced nothing but division. Instead focus on forcing the government to step up a promise to provide equal opportunities to those in rural states, to accelerate public and commercial infrastructure development (which is still severely lacking in most areas and is needed to attract foreign investment), and improve sanitation, healthcare and better education to the underprivileged, which is again typically the rural areas. If the current body in gov't refuses or fails to commit to this then force them out of power and elect an alternative party - that's how you utilise democracy.  In doing so, you will make India a stronger more united country whose output and power potential will guarantee to improve significantly and will increase productivity, attract stronger foreign investment and  improve the per capita GDP that will drastically elevate the living standards of all indians and india's  reputation and position in the global community - the latter  of which should be the ultimate goal and objective here.",5,0

1467,2022-10-12T20:31:32Z,@alen833,"The reason why India is still poor is because they are still blaming Britishers for their own post-colonial failure. If Britishers are the reason why many countries are poorer then why non colonized countries like Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Liberia etc. are poorer than India? Why many colonized countries like America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand are one of the richest countries in the world.  India had 23% of world's GDP in 1750s only because it had 25% of world's population at that period. Countries like Britain, Netherland had 3 times the per capita of India even at that time. Looking at the per-capita, India was one of the poorest countries in the world even in 1750s. Most of the east Asian countries, Middle eastern countries, European countries had more per-capita than India in 18th century. Saying India was one of the richest countries in 17th century just because it had large share of GDP in the world is like saying at present India is richer than UK because India had more GDP than UK. We have to look at per-capita income to find which country is richer and which is not. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong had accepted British colonization brought more positives than negatives to them. Singapores first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, said that before the British arrived, there was no organized human society in Singapore, unless a fishing village can be called a society. Countries like Singapore are richer than India now because they had honest politicians like Lee Kuan Yew who don't unnecessarily blame Britishers and had the courage to accept the fact that colonialism brought more positives than negatives to them unlike Indian politicians.",33,22

Using A=P(1 +r/n)^nt A= $1 million, n = once per year (conservative!) and 0.05 interest (as per the India calculation and t=1227 years I tried this on several online calculators. They all blew up as they found the value too large to deal with.

West tried everything possible so that farm law won't be successful and used their media and press to paint rss hindu and fascism and every other word in dictionary to victimize the middleman who were protesting and hence farm laws failed. There are vested interests who use indian democracy and court to hold any progressive reform and keep india poor . See the full picture. It's not as easy as you're saying. Narmada bachao andolan is another prime example where this so much essential dam project was delayed through vested agenda activism for decades and finally the project was many times over it's original cost. Today narmada dam is serving million of people in Gujarat but when it was conceived same western press and urban naxal cabal made it hell through various means so that the project doesn't become successful.

So its not an argument, its a fact. British did messed up our economy because of their loots. They were starving India and was feeding London when they were in control. Till date they have not apologized officially for what they did to our people back in those days.  One question, you mentioned that one of the reasons why Indian economy didn't grew as fast as it could because it didnt followed the western system and the British leaving the country resulted in India splitting apart. My question is before 1947, The great Britishers were running the country, they were there in the country for about 250-300 years. So why were the people in our country starving during that time, why was the economy not growing at that time, at that time isn't the western economic model being followed because obviously our people didn't had any control, the Britishers were running the country. The fact is that when those Britishers left our country, the literacy rate of India was around 13%. Why was it so low even after so many hundreds of years of British rule in India and their so called civilization.",0,0

But that majorly influences the degeneration of its own industrial and infrastructural development. When Indian people get migrated in such mass, implementing their intellectual property in the developed countries that results the decline of the country of origin. There wouldn't have been any need of migration if the governments were efficient in implementing its industrial growth upgrading India to a welfare state.   In a nutshell, when a country pushes its citizens in order to emigrate to the developed countries, that clearly make us realise how least it cares about its citizens socio-economic wellbeing. Both central and federal governments need to adopt appropriate and innovative  developmental solutions, instead of looking for scapegoats elsewhere.",0,0
1775,2022-07-08T22:45:00Z,@yathindrak1295,One reason India remains very poor and lawless is due to the rampant corruption of bureaucrats at all levels. The government (central or states) refuses to prosecute them (in most cases) even when charges of corruption are very obvious.  The British rulers gave Indian bureaucrats an iron shield of protection from any prosecution since the latter worked for British interests and not those of the people. That tradition still continues unhinged even though the country is free. The most punishment the officers get now is a transfer of posting or a cut in the annual increment in salary which they make up by finding more schemes to extract bribes from the common citizen whom they pledge to serve.  No government including the current one has shown the guts to break this cycle and send corrupt officials to the court to face charges.,3,0

In short, Britain's aristocracy (the rich fuckers) basically bought the indentured populations of the Indian Mughals and Maharajas to work to make wealth for the British aristocracy.... The Poor of India were enslaved by the British aristocracy, who paid the Mughals and Maharajas vast amounts of wealth for the privilege, I.E The \""elites\"" from BOTH countries made VAST profits, while those at the \""bottom\"" of the countries died in their millions. Look at Britain through the time of the Raj, and maybe take my own family as an example. We are, for many generations, British born, and yet never willingly took part in any actions against colonials, or benefitted from the boundless wealth raked in by the British aristocracy who orchestrated the siphoning off of the treasures of the empire for themselves. Indeed the only \""benefits\"" gained by my family were 2 of my G Grandparents who died of typhus in the slums of Liverpool at the turn of the 20th century, while 3 of my 4 grandparents were dead in their 40s through ailments of poverty and exploitation, and countless children through my family tree registered as dying in their early childhood, did THEY benefit from the untold wealth stolen from India? Are they and the millions others of the \""lower classes\"" of British society to be lumped in with the British \""elites\"" and held responsible of the crimes orchestrated by those at the top of British society?   To boil it down to its pure essence, the cause of poverty has NEVER been \""British\"" Vs \""Indian\"" but instead \""rich\"" Vs \""poor\"", as can be seen today when the excuse of misrule by the \""Raj\"" causing India's poverty has worn very thin, no longer can we \""the British\"" be held up as being responsible for India's continuing poverty, the truth is that it is now India's OWN rich and corrupt \""elites\"" that perpetuate the inequalities of India society, just the same as in almost all countries of the world, but obviously to a much greater extent than most.

When compared to the western approach this is an accurate assessment. We need to understand the industrial age followed immediately after the age of colonizing, those nations had money to industrialize from the practices of colonizing. India and China both took their nations out of hunger using mainly socialist tools. Affordability for local consumption is the priority for government having a large western base of the customer will make food price sky rocket and see the poorer indians starve again. Western governments are focused on the needs of a business before the people. Lots of western households buy groceries on credit cards meaning people live on a credit line. This is a complicated issue with so many issues past, present, and future developing a self-sufficient country that can produce all it needs by itself outweighs the need to be highly efficient in one sector so that you can import what you can't produce if you look at the current geopolitical situation if the world went to war who will need Japan efficient TV manufacturers.

India is just like how China was back then before communist take over. A country of selfish and greed individuals,  that kept the country as a broken dish.  It is easier to  control those that don't get along than those that think for each other as one. Now India still didn't learn anything and believe in the West. India and China are the two perfect countries to show the world the difference between democracy and communist.  Both countries have big population and one follow democracy and the other follow communist.  After a few decades,  India is so poor and the people are suffering for the wealthy to enjoy.  But China is communist and after a few decades,  China is rich and its people are enjoying life. India failed because they listen to the West and choose democracy. India didn't understand that democracy is not run by the people,  it's run by capitalism.  Because the people are poor and the rich are the boss because they are the ones that give you job. Freedom comes with a heavy cost. India have to wake up and learn from China instead of fighting them. India's war with China benefits the West. Instead of working together,  they got India to fight what can help them. India can only change and get out of poverty by working together and help each others  instead of listening to foreign advises. The more a country get involved with US, the worse they get. India is run by America's puppets. Countries that don't depend on anyone else is the most freedom out of all. How did our ancestors survive without trades or depending on other countries when the world wasn't connected? Now that the is connected and trades are form and we become more dependent on others and useless.  We focus so much in materialism that we forget how to be independent.

Since you can see South American countries many of them got rich suddenly and then inflation spiked.  Getting rich suddenly is not always sustainable and this is the reason why having a democracy is good.  Since people who will negatively affected by decision speak up.  Its true a lot of them try to put agenda which is only for them and reduce growth.  BUt a lot of factor that lead economic collapsed are also nullified. So the video points it right India has slow and steady growth.  This will also help it slowly improving economic & social condition of people.  I definitely think if India grows rich suddenly only 5-10% people will soak up majority of money.,1,0

You repeatedly say that the capitalist side of things was not working either in opposition to the government. Then you give reasons about how the government was interfering with the capitalist side of things. This is not a flaw in capitalism, but a flaw of an over involved government system. Often the US is slurred with this fallacy as well. People will point to our healthcare system, for example. But our healthcare system is one of the most removed systems from capitalism. We have so many regulations and government control, it can hardly be called capitalist anymore.   My point is, you cannot criticize capitalism when the system you are criticizing is not a capitalist system.",1,0

The British started the Worlds first industrial revolution and while they benefited themselves in India so India benefited from technology  most of the rest of the world did not have access to. The fact the people in power colluded with the British says just as much about them as it does the British. The people in power in India before the British arrived  were put in power by the Indians not the British. The British dealt with what was already in place when they first set foot in India.    The Indian population is too large - there are too many mouths to feed  for its GDP.  That's the reality.      If  India produced the current GDP with only 5% of its population then it would be on a par with Western economies.  India has concentrated on education in science and engineering  but it has too many people in these areas  and now they can't find work. That is mismanagement by Indians not the British.    To blame the British for India being involved in WW2 is  pathetic.  Without the British India would have been overrun by the Japanese and then you  really would have something to complain about .   The British were broke at the end of WW2  due to fighting  more battles on more fronts than any other country and for longer.  70 years on per head of population India has only 1/20th of its GDP.   Stop blaming others for your own faults. if more Indians spent time trying to sort out corruption and mismanagement than bleating about what the British supposedly did hundreds of years ago everyone,not least the Indians, would be better off.",0,1

Peasants with an axe is less efficient than american farmer with new technologies. Good and very fertile soils is not always a blessing, it teaches powerfull that property are more important that people. Europeans have better skills with a technology.

If India was rich in the eighteenth century, and its riches got wiped out by 1947, it would have figured out a way by now, how to regain its former position to become rich agaIn. Societies dont lose their collective memories that easily.  For example, China was rich too, along with India, in the eighteenth century. Together we had  67% of  world GDP.    China didnt get colonized by the British, not wholesale like India. But the British did turn the Chinese into drug addicts by flooding China with opium. After that, what the Chinese did to themselves was worse than what the colonizers would have done.  For example, from 1949 until his death in 1776, Mao turned the Chinese from capitalists into communists, he instituted land reform against landlords, ran several campaigns, including the Cultural Revolution, in which millions of people, mostly intellectuals, were persecuted.   He ruled China through an autocratic and totalitarian regime responsible for mass repression as well as destruction of religious and cultural artifacts and sites.The government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions.   By 1976, China was on par with India. Today, it is a world superpower.  How? Why?  Because, creating wealth is in the Chinese DNA.  Nobody can erase that.  It is said that India had a glorious past. Maybe. But we forgot it. For example, we  boast that Mohenjodaro had indoor plumbing and indoor toilets. What happened to them?  Did conquerors and colonizers take them away?  How do you lose the craft ware of an infrastructure like that?  It is true that we excelled in science and technology. Students from China and the rest of the world would come to our universities to study like we go to the USA Today.   But we were lazy. We were only interested in basic research. We did the fun stuff but were not interested in doing the grunt work to publish and to commercialize it.  The Arabs used to travel to India, learn the science, and then publish it in Europe. Their intention was not to plagiarize or appropriate the technology (though human nature being what it is, some of that might have happened.). That is how The Hindu Number System became the Arabic Number System. I had a white professor in the US who insisted on calling it the Hindu Number System because he believed in giving credit where credit was due.  Ramanujan exasperated his Cambridge professors who would plead with him to prove his theorems and lemmas , identities and equations before publishing them. He didnt see the need for proving them because they  came to him via divine inspiration. Fortunately for him, of his thousands of results, all but a dozen or two have now been proven correct.[8] But his Cambridge professors were trying to inoculate him from  plagiarism  and from the charge of plagiarism. Cambridge had a methodology.  Too bad his undergraduate mathematics departments didnt have one.  My bottom line is that we should stop blaming colonizers and invaders for our poverty. The fault, dear Brutus is not in our stars, But in ourselves.\""   - Shakespeare",1,2

Luckily the younger generations are moving away from the religious and caste system so hope is beyond the horizon. Soon to be the largest population, the market for products is humongous so better to tap into efficient capitalism sprinkled with socialism to come up on top. 21st century belongs to the East and India has to step up to be a superpower.",7,0

This video severely downplays the role played by the British pre-independance, not just from an economic point of view, but also from a cultural, political and social. The Bengal famine was as much a product of British negligance/Churchill's lack of empathy as it was of drought. Everything the British did during the Raj left Indian Industries broken and completely dependent on the Raj. And then the British up and left this hot boiling mess, also cutting up the country right through its womb and giving birth to 2 completely broken masses. In fact it was expected India won't survive. Economy was not the only worry for Independent India. But so were politics, defense, and internal peace. I am glad India established a democracy, yes its not perfect, but we didn't succumb to our own military like our neighbours. Assimilating all those scattered princely states to make a contiguous geographical entity took almost 20 years and one Iron Man. But this was very important to prevent the country from imploding under its own conflicts. Right after independence, India has been constantly in conflict with its neighbours over disputed territory. 4 wars in 70 years. That wasn't easy. Yes, India completely shat on itself and missed a lot of economic opportunities. But it managed to survive on all the other fronts, and all of these aspects were related. We endured, contrary to the belief of our former conquerors. All the other aspects have mostly been taken care of, even if they are still ongoing, we are in some sort of an equilibrium when it comes to internal peace, defense and politics. Now India should really focus on improving its economic policies, and hopefully there won't be any more drama from the other aspects.",2,0

2916,2022-03-25T13:22:46Z,@BharadwajGiridhar,"Recap & Summary:   Summary:  - Obviously the british (They've done this to almost everybody in the world - but look at the size of their country, it's so small! Yet they put a huge emphasis on innovation and had the right resources). - A lot of bad luck caused by bad weather.  - Internal conflicts leading to a lack bold decisions from any government.  - Government trying to take control over the economy (incorporating the worst parts of Socialism x Capitalism)  - Not allowing free market capitalism and inturn reducing efficiency to the floor. (Taking over steel industries and not allowing new companies to be registered faster)  - Lack of emphasis on innovation. (Anecdotal evidence, but western countries invented petrol bunks that are self serving and vending machines, so individual productivity would go high - to this day, in India people hire people instead of machines because the person's salary is lower than the cost of potential damage / misuse of the machine.) - The lack of citizens feeling pride about the country. - Elites who felt giving farmers more money meant lesser profits, making the system broken. (Corruption, Lobbying, blocking good economic policies) - India relatively closed off from outside countries for trade and business. Moral of the story:  The job of the government is to  1. collect more taxes from companies that don't innovate instead of the middle class.  2. regulate companies from becoming monopolies  3. Incentivize competition within companies. 4. Never have sectors run by governments.   5. Find the right balances Comparative Advantages (Building what you're good at, buy what you can't produce like Japan)  as opposed to Atma Nirbhar (self-sufficiency, while this is usually a great thing from preventing our country to be dependant, the tradeoff is we produce lesser cost-quality products and inefficient companies. We have huge import taxes for buying stuff from abroad, that needs to be cut off.  It also means companies can't sell abroad at a higher margin!) - both sizes have equal trade offs. 6. Invest in research of agriculture. Today this India buys a lot of seeds from abroad because it failed to create agritech research that help us produce better seeds. 7. Try to open up more to the world economy. This is why people choose Bangladesh, Vietnam over India (but again this is a conscious choice because of british trauma)  8. Only 55% of Indians are able to understand a basic story indicating the failure of our education system.",3,0

The reason the UK was kicked out of India was because the population was starving. When the UK and Indian collaborators left the country they took India's wealth with them. To build from nothing into a self sustaining economy takes time. There was an uneducated workforce that had the problem of figuring out how to govern, and manufacturer in the absence of the colonizers, and collaborators that left India in ruins. There was no marshall plan similar to Germany or Japan. India is finally coming out the other side of colonialism. Hopefully the new India will be wary of colonial powers \""promises\"". If India allows the constant infighting and corruption to plague it's internal politics the westerns will be back to rip the country apart all over again.

It fails to talk of welfare schemes for the people, programs which only the government can implement because leaving it to the private sector would mean disaster for the people.

My love for India is very genuine and I have always worn Rudraksha beads since I was 14.... Indian food and classical ragas and religious thinking opened my mind and out my own culture in context growing up...... to feel such huge hatred and racism online for being White British and being blamed for India's woes en mass by thousands of people..... was a shock and that is what brought me to study this matter after people sending me links how UK stole hundreds of trillions of $ from India... as a student of Hayek  and seeing how ludicrous some of the other comments were in India.... and how uneducated so many were..... in their masses... it has lead me to look into this more.

2999,2022-03-17T02:43:24Z,@taimalik1110,"Here, let me save you 41 minutes and 07 seconds of your life...the reason why India is still poor and relies on donations from Bill Gates and UNICEF and missionaries like Mother Teresa is because of its completely corrupt politicians, who literally pit each state against one another, based on ethnic, cultural, linguistic, economic, geographic and above all, religious differences. The same is true in Pakistan, where I'm from originally, but in the case of India, instead of managing its internal affairs, it continues to seek geopolitical challenges with both Pakistan and China. All three are nuclear neighbors. This is why India is so hopelessly poor. I as a Pakistani want the best for our region, even Pakistan and Bangladesh have decades to go before they are anywhere near the level of India in terms of economic output. However, India still spends more Rupees on nukes and other military technology than on social infrastructure for its 1.3+ billion people, per capita. And if that wasn't enough, it gets worse. Instead of having serious debates on how best to govern its people and create homegrown capitalistic ventures, the spineless Indian government is marginilizing its minorities and banning clothing that women normally wear in public, resulting in its brightest people being forced to emigrate to the US to work at Microsoft and Google, where their talents shine. How small-minded can such politicians be, where instead of talking about climate change, they care more about how a woman should dress or which religious services will be supported by the government. So much for being democratic and secular, you hypocritical tyrants in the Modi RSS Neo-Nazi regime! Oh and don't forget that the largest number of farmers in the world, per capita, that commit suicide are located within India. And this is because, Monsanto and other agricultural and multinational corporations rape and pillage the wealth of common Indian folks and buy their cheap whore-politicians in New Delhi. This is why India is still poor! I'm not saying this out of hatred against India, I'm saying this because of the cold, hard facts. Moreover, every Indian that is not rich, which is hundreds of millions of people, dreams about moving abroad and leaving India. That is NOT a recipe for a successful economy! The main problem is that an older generation of Indians are still stuck in their former glory, the days of the Maharajas and Ashoka. Meanwhile, the US and China have landed rovers on Mars. If a country like India has leaders in office that divide the country up based on ethnicity, religion and revisionist history, then who needs enemies? At least in Pakistan, they finally elected a leader who gives a damn about his country, instead of sucking the cocks of Western elites in NYC and London and Paris, the elites who continue to profit off of the misery of millions in both Pakistan and India. I'm really sorry to say this, but at the rate Indian corruption spreads, which is faster than coronavirus, India will see violent independence movements take place. Imagine a ceramic dinner plate and shatter it on the stone floor. That is how India can break up into several countries, if motherfuckers like Modi continue to promote Hindutva over modernity!",0,2

These solutions will work in any country: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Cameroon, Mali, Iraq, Bolivia, Ecuador, you name it..  1st: Strict birth control and decrease of population: The best way to do it is orienting people to have children at an age of 25 years or older, preferably no more than one child for couple. It has always worked, and it was much more effective when the population did it voluntarily. The case of China is the clearest proof, because of the huge numbers involved, though it was compulsory and there was not the minimum age, which currently is creating problems for the social security system. Besides China, there are many other examples where it worked very well. Japan and practically all countries in Europe are the most known. 2nd: The government must imitate what South Korea government did, giving total support to the wealth families to thrive to create strong and competitive corporations. If there are not wealth families with the right profile to do it, get some of them that have the profile that it takes from other countries. Also, it invested heavily in education of high quality. No system has worked as good and as fast as that to increase the living standards of a country's population. I keep wondering what is taking so long for the rest of the world to follow SK step by step in regards of that. There are other strategies that worked in other countries with good results, some of them with similarities to what was done in the South Korean, but the deepness that South Korea went is the most effective way that was ever put in place. 3rd: The heaviest possible investments in tourism and environment protection, creating sustainable ways of living in every aspect, making any country that implements it an example to the rest of the world and giving it an undisputable solid reputation. Africa and most countries in the south and southeast Asia have lots of wildlife and ecologic parks, and that type of asset the world is in a fast-increasing need of. The more the merrier. Every country that had invested in cleaning rivers and other similar environment friendly actions had had great benefits from that type of approach, especially in the long term of the economics and in regards of the health of the population. The biggest example is how New York City saves billions of dollars every year with a very low cost and high quality tap water. Despite being difficult to implement, due to the lobbies of large companies in ways that would make the best magicians embarrassed of themselves, it is a win-win option. Any country that does this in a deeper way will be followed by the rest of the world and reap unparalleled rewards and respect from it.   A rich country with rich dwellers doesn't mean everybody, a big part of the population or even anyone has to live unsustainable lifestyles. People can have the means to purchase and build big and unsustainable mansions, for example, and at the same time live in very simple and sustainable houses. That is called wisdom, in a way that is rarely put on practice in the so-called civilized world. We, as humans, only have two right choices: make our lifestyles the most sustainable possible or make our lifestyles the most sustainable possible. Anything else is just not even worth to give an adjective to it.",0,0

3238,2022-02-21T15:57:53Z,@ashish-zr4ot,"(A) How and by how much did Britain rob India?  After the betrayal and defeat of the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-daulah, at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British installed their own puppet, Mir Jafar, as Nawab. The British extracted huge concessions from the defeated Bengalis including land, a monopoly of trade with Europe, and exemption from taxation on internal trade. The British subsequently replaced Mir Jafar with Mir Kasim as Nawab of Bengal. The Bengalis under Mir Kasim were finally driven to revolt when he was in turn sacked by the British and replaced by Mir Jafar for a second term. The Bengalis were defeated at the Battle of Buxar in 1764, and in 1765 the Moghul Emperor Shah Alam was persuaded to grant the power of taxation (diwani) in Bengal to the British East India Company. The British in turn sub-contracted rapacious revenue collection to Bengalis.  Some of the revenue would go the Emperor and some to the Nawab, with the remainder being retained by the British. The British described this as farming the Bengali peasants (ryots), but over-taxing of Bengalis meant that 10 million Bengalis perished in the Great Bengal Famine of 1769-1770. The East India Company used about one third of the collected revenue to buy Indian goods and thus the Bengalis were in effect being paid for their goods through the exorbitant taxes applied to them. 15 years later, exorbitant British taxation led to famine in the Gangetic plain to the west of Bengal. Indeed such British excesses led to the British Parliament (unsuccessfully) impeaching Warren Hastings (first Governor General of India and father by adultery of Jane Austens cousin Eliza) for crimes such as the violation of the Begums of Oudhhe was of course eventually acquitted.(6)  By the 1840s the East India Company had dominion over most of present-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh but the British Government was increasingly keen for greater involvement in the exploitative proceedings. In 1847 the British Government introduced a scheme whereby those wishing to buy Indian goods could only do so using Council Bills issued by the British Crown in London. Traders would pay for such Bills in gold and silver and use them to pay Indian producers who would in turn cash them in for rupees at the local colonial officerupees that been exacted by exorbitant taxation.(5)  In his book Inglorious Empire. What the British did to India, Shashi Tharoor describes how the British looted and de-industrialized India and thus paid for Britains Industrial Revolution and violent global dominance: At the beginning of the eighteenth century, as the British economic historian Angus Maddison has demonstrated, Indias share of the world economy was 23 per cent, as large as all of Europe put together. (It had been 27 per cent in 1700, when the Mughal Emperor Aurangzebs treasury raked in 100 million in tax revenues alone.) By the time the British departed India, it had dropped to just over 3 per cent. The reason was simple: India was governed for the benefit of Britain. Britains rise for 200 years was financed by its depredations in India ((7), page 3(8)). This deadly and merciless taxation was accompanied by massive de-industrialization of India. Thus before the invasion by the British, India led the world in textiles, agriculture and metallurgy, but rapidly became an exporter of raw materials and an importer of goods manufactured in Britain.(6)(8)  Professor Utsa Patnaiks estimate of Britains theft from India amounting to $45 trillion (1765-1938)(3)(5)can be compared with estimates based on GDP considerations. According to Wikipedia, Indias share of the world economy declined from 24.4% in 1700 to 4.2% in 1950. Indias share of global industrial output declined from 25% in 1750 to 2% in 1900.(9)From available data on Indias GDP and Indias share of world GDP since 1700(10),(1)one can get a very rough estimate of what Indias cumulative GDP could have been from 1700-2003 if the British had not robbed and raped India.  Thus the cumulative GDP (PPP) for India is given below for 6 periods since 1700 (A) at the observed average % of world GDP, and (B) if the average Indian % of world GDP had remained at the pre-British invasion 24.0% in 1770.  1700-1820: (A) $13.1 trillion (20.3%) versus (B) $15.8 trillion (24.0%).1820-1870: (A) $6.2 trillion (14.0%) versus (B) $10.5 trillion (24.0%).1870-1913: (A) $7.3 trillion (9.8%) versus (B) $18.0 trillion (24.0%).1913-1950: (A) $7.9 trillion (5.5%) versus (B) $34.4 trillion (24.0%).1950-1973: (A) $8.3 trillion (3.5%) versus (B) $$56.8 trillion (24.0%).1973-2003: (A) $41.5 trillion (5.5%) versus (B) $180.9 trillion (24.0%).  It has taken India 7 decades to partially recover from 2 centuries of rapacious British imperialism.The difference in cumulative GDP is $316.4 trillion (1700-2003) and $44 trillion (1700-1950), the latter estimate of Indias deprivation being consonant with Professor Utsa Patnaiks estimate that the British had stolen $45 trillion from India between 1765 and 1938.",1,1
3239,2022-02-21T15:56:46Z,@ashish-zr4ot,"(B) 1.8 billion Indians died avoidably from egregious deprivation under the British.  Imposed poverty kills. Poverty-derived avoidable mortality (avoidable death, excess mortality, excess death, premature death, untimely death, death that should not have happened) can be estimated as the difference between the actual deaths in a country and the deaths expected for a peaceful, decently governed country with same demographics (birth rate and percentage of children).(12)Below are listed in rough chronological order some shocking salient features of the deadly impact of rapacious British imperialism over 2 centuries in British India, Britains Auschwitz.  In the 1769-1770 Great Bengal Famine 10 million out of 30 million over-taxed Bengalis starved to death(6),(13).Scores of millions of Indians perished in man-made famines between the 1769-1770 Great Bengal Famine and the 1942-1945 WW2 Bengal Famine.(6)Using Indian census data 1870-1950, assuming an Indian population of about 200 million in the period 1760-1870, and estimating by interpolation from available data an Indian avoidable death rate in (deaths per 1,000 of population) of 37 (1757-1920), 35 (1920-1930), 30 (1930-1940) and 24 (1940-1950), one can estimate Indian excess deaths of 592 million (1757-1837), 497 million (1837-1901) and 418 million (1901-1947), roughly 1.5 billion in total or 1.8 billion including the Native States.(14)Scores of millions of distant British keeping hundreds of millions of Indians on the edge of starvation was enabled by relatively small numbers of British soldiers and much greater numbers of well-fed Indian soldiers threatening requisite violence.(6)It has been estimated by Amaresh Misra that 10 million Indians were massacred in the decade after the 1857 Indian Mutiny (Indian Rebellion) as reprisals for 2,000 British deaths.(15),(16)Despite a very high birth rate, the Indian population did not increase between 1860 (292 million) and 1934 (292 million) [17]. This is indicative of massive avoidable deaths from imposed deprivation that can be estimated as 745 million (1860-1934) or an average of about 10 million Indian avoidable deaths from deprivation per year.(14)Addressing the House of Commons in 1935, racist, imperialist and mass murderer Winston Churchill made an extraordinary confession in stating of the subjugated Indians: In the standard of life they have nothing to spare. The slightest fall from the present standard of life in India means slow starvation, and the actual squeezing out of life, not only of millions but of scores of millions of people, who have come into the world at your invitation and under the shield and protection of British power.(6),(18),(19)7 years later Churchill commenced the deliberate starving to death over 4 years of 6-7 million Indians in Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and Assam as the British exported grain from India and slashed grain imports.(6)8. In the 1942-1945 WW2 Bengali Holocaust (Indian Holocaust, WW2 Bengal Famine) 6-7 million Indians were deliberately starved to death for strategic reasons by the British with Australian complicity (Australia was complicit by denying starving India food from its huge wartime food stores).(6),(12)(14), (19)(27)This atrocity has been white-washed from history and general public perception by successive generations of Anglo journalist, editor, politician and academic presstitutes. Indeed perpetrator Churchill made no mention for this atrocity in his 6-volume history The Second World War for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.(6)According to Professor Utsa Patnaik Indian per capita annual consumption of food was 200 kg in 1900, but went down to 137 kg during World War II and in 1946.(28)This is consonant with the following data from my book Jane Austen and the Black Hole of British History: The population of India at that time [1940] was about 400 million and total grain production was 50 to 70 million tons annually. The population was growing at a rate of about 5% per year and there was a requirement of net imports of about 1-2 million tons of grain per annum to make up for deficiencies Behrens figures for grain shipments (in tons) for India in 1942-1945 are as follows: 1942 (30,000), 1943 (303,000), 1944 (639,000) and 1945 (871,000). The 1942 shipment involved 2 lots from Australia contracted for at the rate of 15,000 tons per month to supply the Indian Army (the balance of the demand was not shipped that year). 2.4 million men served in the Indian Army during World War 2. This estimate can be reduced since not all of these were in the Army at the same time, scores of thousands were in the Mediterranean theatre (250,000 served there), had been captured by the Japanese or had died. Taking the gross Indian annual grain production estimates of about 60 million tons for 400 million people, we see that the average consumption was 0.15 tons per person per year (obviously more for adults and less for children). The annual requirement for about 2 million men in the reduced Indian Army was therefore 0.3 million tons. We can arrive at a figure having a similar order of magnitude from the 1942 contracted requirement of 15,000 tons per month i.e. 0.18 million tons for a whole year. If we assume that an Indian Army soldier required 50% more food than the average Indian we would estimate that the annual grain requirement for a 2 million strong Indian Army would be about 0.45 million tons. The average yearly importation in 1942-1945 was 0.46 million tons and thus we can see that the grain actually imported was merely enough to feed the Indian Army (pages 156-158, Chapter 15(6)).Shashi Tharoor in Inglorious Empire: The British left a society with 16 per cent literacy, a life expectancy of 27, practically no domestic industry and over 90 per cent living below what today we would call the poverty line ((7), page 215(8)). As indicated in (6) above, the life expectancy of 27 years corresponded to about 10 million Indian avoidable deaths from deprivation peryear.Things got much better after Indian Independence. The 1.8 billion avoidable Indian deaths from deprivation under the genocidal British over 2 centuries is not that surprising when one considers that despite modern medicine, antibiotics, and the essential absence of famine, avoidable deaths from deprivation in the period 1950-2005 in India totalled 0.35 billion.(14)Annual avoidable deaths as a percentage of population fell from a genocidal 2.4% per year in 1947 under the British to 0.35% per year in 2005, but the population of India increased from 380 million in 1947 to about 1,100 million in 2005. Today 4 million Indians die avoidably from deprivation each year as compared to zero (0) in China that, unlike capitalist India, has overcome endemic poverty.(11)The 3 Laws of Thermodynamics that underlie Chemistry, Physics and industry are (1) the energy of a closed system is constant, (2) the entropy (disorder, lack of information content) strives to a maximum, and (3) there is zero molecular motion in a pure crystal at absolute zero degrees Kelvin (-273. 15 degrees Centigrade). Polyas 3 Laws of Economics are based on the 3 Laws of Thermodynamics and posit that (1) Price (P)  Cost of Production (COP) = Profit (p), (2) deception about COP strives to a maximum, and (3) No work, price or profit on a dead planet.(29)The major cost of production (COP) in the British Raj was the passive mass murder of 1.8 billion Indians through deadly impoverishment, and in keeping with Polyas Second Law of Economics, the British strove to deceive the world about this horror.  The capitalist perpetrator deception continues in a neoliberal One Percenter-dominated world that is existentially threatened by nuclear weapons (a nuclear winter from nuclear war would wipe out most of Humanity and the Biosphere), poverty (15 million people die avoidably from deprivation each year, 4 million in India) and man-made climate change (about 1 million people die from climate change each year but this set to increase to an average of 100 million deaths per year this century if urgent, requisite action is not taken).(30),(32)Poverty kills. History ignored yields history repeated.(6)Peace is the only way but silence kills and silence is complicity. Please inform everyone you can.",1,1

To begin with, saying that MK Gandhi-led non-cooperation movement led to India's independence is not true at all. Gandhi was a tool of the British colonial imperialists and he and his croonies actually fit the description of \""elites\"" that you have referred to repeatedly. If you want to give a name to that, it's the political organization called Indian National Congress(INC) led by another British tool and Gandhi's favourite confidant, Jawaharlal Nehru. These two fitted the description of the \""Men of straw\""   of that Churchill had referred to while opposing transfer of power to Indian leaders. He meant that power would fall in the hands of such scoundrels and as we saw later, that was what happened. I'm no fan of Churchill but even the worst species of humans sometimes end up uttering some truths inadvertently.  Nehru's 17 year reign in power immediately after India became sovereign, was the biggest disaster for India and all the confused and half-witted decisions that you were referring to, were actually begun by him and his daughter and grandson.  All the right decisions were taken by people outside the ambit of this goddamned family whether as part of the INC or other political forces.  India today has an even stronger democratic order than at any time earlier but interestingly, it is building infrastructure at a speed that only China is capable of. India is attracting foreign direct investment more than China now. So, we must be doing a lot of things right.  At the same time, we have seen how the pandemic was managed in many of the advanced industrialized countries and the way we handled it for such a huge population with resources considered inadequate and even backward by the standards of those countries.  Anyway, such debates are never-ending and let me thank you for a very good presentation, overall.  You seem to be East Asian, probably Japanese.  One great quality of people from the east Asia is your directness in understanding priorities.  I am a great admirer of this east Asian quality. There's no room for nonsense in matters of priority, unlike what we have among a large section of our people here in India. ",0,0

Go to college and get in a couple group projects to see how long that attitude lasts when surrounded by people who aren't. Thus the crux of the issue is just human nature. Humans naturally do the least amount of effort to get the most gain. . that's also a huge drive as to why we innovate so that we don't have to work as hard.

A wealthier and more prosperous India can only benefit humankind. I know that developed nations often have certain career types in proportions of the population, such as countries generally have around this many % of doctors in their laborforce, researchers, industrialists, and so on. This how much better off we'd, as a species, would be if the world had India's massive population in a similarly distributed proportion? Millions and millions more medical researchers, million upon millions more entrepreneurs bringing innovation someone else might not think of for years, etc.  Plus, I would welcome a challenge from India in a competition of our economies. The US economy may still be growing, but almost no one except for the top 0.1% see the benefits of that. With India becoming more and more powerful, companies in the US will have to innovate and compete again and hopefully start distributing the wealth amongst the actual population and not just disappearing into the bank accounts of the ultra-rich, where it sits, doing nothing, since the rich skip paying taxes most of the time too. All while having more money than anyone could ever spend in a hundred lifetimes.

The United States even fought the Revolutionary Wars over a 40 year period in an effort to totally excise the British from their country. Few countries are so exploitative of others that they face wars to remove them from any power over their colonies.",0,0

It was a forced foreign meddling, nothing else. Would you say that American soldiers ruled Afghanistan for 20 years?  Of course not. You will simply say that American soldiers have now returned back to where they came from. The same was the case with the British. Nobody wanted the British because they came to India for profit, not rule. We are falsely taught that they ruled. How can somebody rule more than 560 princely states and more than 6000 communities? They might have been good administrators but not rulers. Plus, a ruler will never get scared of the uprising of the INA (Indian National Army) and surrender right away (i.e. 21 October 1943). Britishers were foreign miscreants. Why would a ruler feel scared of the uprising of the Indian National Army?

3897,2022-01-01T16:11:34Z,@amsharanx,I am from India but living in the West. I grew up in India and lived until late sixties. India started correctly by industrializing and stll continues with the same foundations laid by Nehru and Shashtry. The later prime ministers ought to have modified  the approach as the population was growing and should have allowed far more innovation by opening up the country for more imports and exports rather than insulating India from external influences. The second prom with India is the randomized thinking of the population which is not conducive for fatster industrialization.  People confuse freedom with chaos. A chaotic thinking will not lead to progress. Western countries have democracy but not anarchy and the laws are stricktly enforced which are  a complete failure in India. Next one is massive corruption - all checks and balances fail. Indians live in the past ( ancient times ) but science and technology is not emphasized in education and policies. It is the industrial revolution which has allowed the West and East Asian countries to leap forward whereas Indians continue to live in ancient times.,59,24

Food shortage  was not because of the machine and inefficiency  as you mentioned, but because the Indian agricultural resource was forced to cultivate raw resources for Europe Industries like  Indian blue dye, Sugarcane for Suger, cotton for cloth industries ... etc  More people were killed in the Bengal Famines in 1943 than the number of Jews killed by Adolf Hitlers Nazi regime. But since there is no special day of remembrance for them, today, Human Rights Day is as good an occasion as any to remind ourselves of what must never be forgotten - perhaps the worst human rights violations committed on our soil. The Bengal Famine of 1943 in particular was caused not by drought but by a complete and deliberate policy failure of the British government in England led by Winston Churchill, a theory that received scientific backing through a study published in 2019.  Amartya Sen had argued as far back as 1981 that there should have been enough supplies to feed Bengal in 1943. And in Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India (2017), Shashi Tharoor wrote, Churchill deliberately ordered the diversion of food from starving Indian civilians to well-supplied British soldiers and even to top up European stockpiles, meant for yet-to-be-liberated Greeks and Yugoslavs. British actively destroyed local industries and skills and innovation and forced to buy a product produced in their country for 200 years until there was nothing left to destroy.",0,0

4002,2021-12-21T23:54:54Z,@JSmusiqalthinka,"I wanna point out that socialism/communism and centrally planned/command economies are not synonymous.  Certainly, command economies were implemented under so-called socialist nation-states. The general concept of a centrally planned economy has also been much debated since the early days of socialism (Fourier, Saint-Simon, Proudhon, Owen, etc.), but this approach has received mixed reviews from others on the Left, at best. Anarchists, Council Communists, libertarians Marxists and other types of left leaning or libertarian socialists have been and are heavily critical of command/centrally planned economies.  Broadly speaking, socialism advocates for means of production, distribution, and exchange of goods and services to be controlled by the community or society at large. This, to me, implies profoundly democratic, egalitarian and libertarian ideals. After all, the birth of modern socialism came out of a promise to fulfill the promises of the Enlightenment (liberty, egalitarianism, fraternity) in response to how they felt Liberalism and the capitalist mode of production failed to live up to those ideals.  I agree that in the grand scheme of things, command economies are bunk, but they are not intrinsically \""socialist\"".",1,0

After independence, India did not have a decolonization education, on the contrary, it almost inherited the legacy left by the colonists. . At the same time, India is a country where politics and religion are integrated, but religion is ubiquitous to influence all aspects of India, and it has brought reform and development resistance to India's modernization process. In the national economy: India has been rejecting industrialization since independence. It was not until Modi came to power that \""Made in India\"" and \""Independence\"" were called out, But the reality is that the louder Modis political slogans, the higher the growth rate of Indias imports. India looks forward to foreign investment in India, but Indias investment environment is very poor, with outdated infrastructure and logistics, India's self-deemed demographic dividend has been discounted by population education and quality. The inefficiency of the Indian government in formulating and implementing policies, various high taxes, and serious foreign economic protectionism have become obstacles to the sustainable development of the Indian economy. Contrary to the theory that the economic foundation determines the superstructure, Indias characteristic is that the superstructure determines the direction of economic development. Indias current problem is that there is indeed one less leader with a long-term strategic vision. The Modi government is better at shouting slogans and inciting Indian nationalism. The biggest difference between India and China is that India is better at talking about everything, while China is better at doing everything in obscurity.",2,0

4114,2021-12-17T06:46:03Z,@abbeyjv,"In the early years after independance left India with a large exreamly poor population. The rich unjustly expoilted the poor. For example the poor yool loans from private banks and found themselves unable to repay the loan and the banks took over their assets and eventually landed the poor into a bonded labour. To avoid this Banks were nationalised.  Since 2000 the Indian economy grew due to the number of people educated in IT grew rapidly. These people went to more developed countries earned money and brought money into the country. This raised the standard of living for many people. This new elevation of living standards limited the expoitation by the rich.  So to conclude that not going fully towards capital was a mistake. At the time taking the socialistic route was the best option. Today we can control the rich and powerful people, business and countries, so we can afford to be more liberal toward privatisation",0,0

4212,2021-12-09T14:07:13Z,@johnsnowkumar359,"Main reason? reason for India being always poor::: excessive population growth in India and overgrowth of new born babies in the  already over populated plain states of India is the cause for India being perpetually poor. India is otherwise full of businesses and entrepreneurs. Poor village people are allowed to produce unlimited babies in about 20 of the plains states. This brings down the per capita income income. Per capital income is gross capita income divided by total population count. The solution to increase the per capita income of India is to under-count the population of India. If the population of India is 1600 million, the job of the census depart of India is to say it is 1300 million people. Plus Islamic militants migrate illegally  all the time from Bangladesh (East Pakistan) and Pakistan, to live along remote rivers and remote jungles.  after every census count, various governments of India (both parties) claim po[pulsation of India is  just less tan the population of main,and China. In India, the weather makes it easier to have a flock of children as they will not freeze to death in the villages. Government of India permits uneducated people of villages in every  to have no family planning in terms of size. So certain states like Bengal, Bihar, UP, Delhi, Haryana excess their excess population to other states. If a man originally from Bihar opens a hardware store in Gujarat or Assam, the store owner from a different state will import 5 uneducated laborers from his state of origin. Say, a hardware store owner of Bihar origin or living in Gujarat or Assam who is of Bihar origin or Bengal origin (hardware store owner). If the state government of the destination state is not too strict in letting people of other state origin open up shops, then one million people of Bihar origin end up every second year in rented rooms of  the new place in another state such as Gujarat or Assam. So reason for India being always poor::: excess population growth in India and overgrowth of new born babies in the plain states of India is the cause for India being perpetually poor.",1,0

You state that the system of the Americans (at least at the time of India's decision) was to intimidate other nations with our military to get them to open their markets to us. I am aware that this was the case with Japan in the 1800s, but I know of no other examples.  On the contrary, nations in this hemisphere know the advantage of doing business with our large, relatively wealthy, open market.     India's reluctance to embrace capitalism seems to be a common theme throughout this video, in spite of the fact that you point out the precise reasons that capitalism is superior to a government with strong oversite/control.  Time after time you admit that India had to almost be forced into accepting this reality: That capitalism, when administered wisely, is the most efficient way of producing the products and services needed or wanted in a country.  One reason for this is its incentives.  When one works hard and smart, one is rewarded.  If you have money to invest, and you invest it wisely, you can reap a return.  These incentives where affected as India became reliant on gifts from the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and the Indian government was making the decisions as to where the money would be spent. You also mentioned the principle of comparative advantage.  Yes, like Japan, countries that specialize and negotiate mutually beneficial trade deals with other nations will be better off.   I'm glad to hear that India is able to feed itself now, and that it is growing.  I was also glad to learn of the vast amounts of farm land India possesses.  However, it has substantial obstacles to overcome on its way to becoming the #2 economy in the world.  Some you listed were education, the influence of the Elites, truly taking advantage of comparative advantages with other countries, making it easy for other countries to invest in India including giving them full control of their businesses (not forcing a partnership.)  One obstacle you didn't mention which has been in the news in the last year is the growing dominance of China. The Chinees are known for being ruthless negotiators.  In its quest to become the world's superpower, a goal China recently admitted, China may undercut your markets, and even wage war against India.

4359,2021-11-15T15:41:54Z,@chanbasappa5474,"An excellent documentary/ lecture an indian economy , politics and policies from 1957 to this day. However I want to add / edit few points.  I am a just educated  senior  proffecional person and have worked few years in Europe and returned to India and settled. My past hobby is reading/ studying about indian economy in particular and other developed  and poor countries in the world in general.  With this back ground   i want to make certain comments. No. 1 india woldn,t have earned independence mearly because leaders like  Mahathma Gandhi and Nehru lead the mass movement against British ,professing non cooperation. India got indipendence  because Adolf Hitler inflicted such a major blow to European colonists,Britain and France,so that these countries were unable to spend any money,even to maintain basic security to their own people, to maintain their colonies,so were forced to grant independence to not only to india but to several other dozens of Asian and African countries.though no indian  never liked Hitler we have to say thanks to him, alas!  These are twists and turns of history. 2 point I want make is this,. Indian education is not that bad as you suggest. Indian tertiory health care system is as  good as the best in the world.basic health care is over all not that bad.just recall how India manged the recent pandemic. Also indian science and technology education now a days not doing bad at all. Though lacking in quantity the quality is not compromised . India is a significant supllier of technical manpower to the world today. 3 rd point I want make here is this. Though rich and poor gap in india is much talked about, the thing to be noted is the gap is reducing fast .I mean multi dimensional poverty , though undp publication has not acknowledged in its report of 2021, india,s mpi is around 10 percent,a significant reduction from around 50 percent some two decades ago.please go through alkire et al research  paper on indian poverty rate.4 th and final point is indian primary education. From past ten years every child has to mandatorily  get admitted in a school.and every poor child will receive free  midday meal, free uniforms, and no tuition fees . almost all six hundred thousand villages have such schools.   Finally because india is not a perfect democracy, and our politicians are not all educated and enlightened one, there will be mistakes and flaws in the policies . so no one can be sure when will india become super power, also which economic creteria you take ,ppp GDP or nominal GDP. My take is that if india is able to multiply its gdp by a factor of four  in today's buying power then it will stand along with China and USA. Fastest it could be 2 decades or slow means 3 or more decades. Looking at history from 1757 to 2000 ,how India was wobling ,commiting  economic blunders after blunders,in 2021 india is much stronger and confident with great population bomb exploding behind us, india will certainly become a developed country .",1,0

They laid off 10 millions workers from state-owned factories from 1994-1997 to make those factories fit for WTO. (sold many smaller ones to FD too). China joined RCEP (0 duty for 99% of the importing goods). That meas opening up for Japanese and Korea products. Becasue they belive it is good for upgrading their industries.

The Soviet Union (to extent) was technically capitalist because of the decision to use State Capitalism, which is basically a planned economy. (Yes, look it up).

4450,2021-11-05T09:09:58Z,@ravishbhasin7041,"Biggest Issue with India was always in the fact that they never truly had competent people ruling the nation, except a few times but even when they came they didn't have any great power behind them so they had to do their dance of democracy and were stuck in small time bickering and nonsense. Economy has always been a low priority for India, even Citizens didn't care much for it because this was way too big a issue for their little heads to comprehend because they lived in times without good media coverage, internet connection and even education about the wide subjects.  Why India is moving towards right place now is because the needs of people have changed tremendously and old shit does not fly anymore. Everyone is being connected digitally, more and more people have grown up educated and now media covers 10x more than it did before. This has led to massive awakening of India people who were asleep listening to the slogans like \""East or West. India is the best\"" they had a illusionary picture in their head where they thought India was fine but once they got internet and they saw progress of other nations, it filled them with longing. Things like Liberalization of economy, development of IT industry had led to great growth and allowed Indians to get a taste of wealth. Now that they had tasted wealth, They wanted more and more.   The greatest problem that persisted all through the years of India was Corruption and bureaucracy which made the system useless and inept in eyes of foreign investors. Nobody would invest in India because of that fear. While on other Hand China despite not being transparent, it was bit more efficient with bureaucracy due to its chain of command and power over matters so it handled things better, they were corrupt in their own rights but as long it didn't affect investors it would be fine because that's where they drew the line. This continued to be such a huge problem until now but thankfully due to the handwork of this government they were able to come up with digital systems of governance that reduces interactions with Bureaucracy making them inherently unable to anything. Suddenly, the leakages started being taken care of and treasury made a leap. Transition towards a digital economy, GST and various other policy reforms led to Investors see India as great investment location and even in the time of Corona Crisis where other countries had their Forex reserves dwindle,  India saw its own rise. In Modi's term alone he had received 300 billion USD in reserves, which is exactly the amount India took to gain in its 60 years. Modi did it in 7 years alone and its not stopping whatsoever. GST collections are pretty great too thanks to how much it eased up the tax paying. All this is because we had a competent leader at the top with enough power to do things. He changed the entire outlook of India which was heading towards stagnation.   A grand example of how India is hugely shaping digital world can be seen by how Youtubers are pandering to that audience because now around millions of Internet users have been added into YouTube because they have got hold of cheap internet from Jio. Suddenly the Internet had seen a influx of Indians jumping in and making a place for themselves. India is a huge untapped market still being opened up, you are right about that. India is using that its main selling point and getting things done. The only big issues we have right now is growing demand of energy and our dependency on OPEC for Oil which really bites into our growth.",1,5

Ultimately the Raj persisted after that due to the ability to provide security (stopping people attacking India), reasonably competent administration, and a developing economy - trade with the British Empire. I'd also argue that it's not true that innovation stopped under British Rule - there were considerably fewer famines throughout the colonial period than preceded it, the Bengal Famine occuring largely due to the war. World War 2 affected lots of countries, including the whole of South East Asia, whilst you could describe it as \""being dragged in by Britain\"" the Japanese had no intention of stopping and would certainly have invaded India - without colonial rule and support it's likely they would have been successful.

British empire forced Indians to buy goods produced by them by levying heavy taxes on locally produced goods, making it unviable for the population that was already poor. In the famous salt satyagraha, where people led by Gandhi marched to Dandi and making own salt (yes, even locally produced salt was made uneconomical!) and making own salt. It was impossible to run Indian businesses and thus innovation stopped. Ofcourse the extreme socialism and anti-business approach of Gandhi and Nehru didn't help. Also, it's not only Gandhi's non cooperation that drove the British empire away. Most of British-Indian were made of Indians. They increasingly swore their allegiance to Indian National Army led by Subhash Chandra Bose. British empire was already bleeding because of World War 2, knowing they won't be able to control India any more thru their army, plus colonialism itself became unpopular, the British empire left after 200 years.",0,0

They repeatedly used divide and rule techniques promoting caste systems and religious violence and plundered the population. We are still fighting each other in the subcontinent.  From prosperity to subsistence.  SAARC i e South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation was tried but it has been ignored. Like USA or ASEAN or the European Common markets this could work. But having India as the most important part of the system requires Indias full commitment. The entire subcontinent needs to come together if they want to do well.  The Soviet model failed miserably. Draconian systems like USSR dont work. India has managed to have toxic relationships with all the neighbors. Nepal SriLanka Maldives Pakistan China Bhutan and Bangladesh all have toxic conflicts with India! India was involved in Afghanistan and lost that also. They are currently wanting to emphasize purity of the Hindu religious beliefs known as Hinduttwa and their factories and businesses are not flourishing.  In spite of having most enlightened scientists and talented doctors Covid death were astronomical !  People put up with death as fate or religious fatalism and supported their government as loyal citizens.  Polluting their rivers is so horrible and sad in spite of the fact that Hindu faith respects most rivers as if they are all part of the holy river Ganges. Ganges is the worst polluted river in the world. Religious violence disrespect for women are worse by the decades.  Many things dont make sense at all!  India can make friends with all of Neighbrs including China Nepal Pakistan and SriLanka Maldives Bhutan and Bangladesh as military solutions are unlikely to be profitable or fruitful. Arrogance and hubris has taken over. Chanakkya thoughts are currently dominating the thinking among the elite. But that is predominantly paranoid policies. China has raced ahead racking in profits and truly achieving superpower status. Indian talents experts and scientists are leaving their country in very large numbers for the lucrative jobs in the West.  A quiet abandonment of ship of India going on?

4725,2021-10-27T10:12:46Z,@anoupsukale,"Truth is harsh... 1) In the United States, today, 3 people own more wealth than the lower strata of the population. Japan was closed to the world and after its defeat in the war, they were inclined to clean the slate and sprung back this time to industrialise the nation, also being much smaller a landmass the infrastructure recovery was rather faster than the other nations destroyed by the war, Germany on the other hand developed securing aids by the allies heavily investing in the automobile industry. What did India gain by participating in the war? An agricultural economy, heavily reliant on the monsoons. And a demographic and geopolitical challenge way higher than the Berlin Wall.   2) the United Kingdom, industrialised at a rapid rate in the 19th century owing to the channel of captive markets all over the world as colonies and the same colonies serving as a free resource for raw materials. Basically paying nothing for the raw materials, and taxing heavily on the finished product sold to the same colonies gaining exponential profits, and investment in infrastructure was much more likely to serve this purpose than the people who were colonised. This is well documented and the English government would even go further to use India to calm local uprisings with the Scots, giving them the opportunity to develop infrastructure and British industries on Indian soil, at the expense of the Indian tax payers, and Indian public risk, with the profits withheld by the British government. Written records of colonisation from the very beginning of the British rule, albeit in the early days of the East India company and then the Crown itself shows enormous amount of British investment to shut down existing Indian industries, that would have developed and prospered, creating wealth and income to the newly independent India. So even if by paying the price of millions of indians dying in the famines, India was forced to fuel the two wars alongside the British empire and the allies. The loss of Indian lives during the war cannot be estimated monetarily but the billions of pounds that the colony was forced to invest in the wars, that the Crown had promised to return, never was.   3) the British government divided people furthermore into the Indian subcontinent, and the Indian subconscious, by making the caste system that had been preventing unemployment for the masses (it had its darker side, no denying to that) by making it a prerequisite of the Indian census. The division of the subcontinent was done on the basis of religion to begin with, and then by caste to further divide the people under the same religious umbrella. This was not the end, as this policy led to the last stroke of the parting British raj by dividing the subcontinent into the geopolitical hot-spot of war waging nations that we have today, and who'd lived for many years in harmony. Some of the first Christians called India their home thanks to the apostle Saint Thomas, making India a lot more older Christian settlement outside the levant than the British Isles, the last remaining zoroastrians from persia, one of the first Muslims, and going back in the past even one of the lost tribes of Israel made India their home and are still living in the country. So yes the caste system that was already in a bad state was reinforced by the British government so that India would suffer from the consequences even today. Also for those pinpointing the caste system as a reason for the lower castes to not having any opportunities of rising up in the society, have some more research to do that concerns the reservation system or quotas that was established in the Indian constitution gauranting free education, reserved seats, and priority in government jobs to make amends for the centuries of injustice suffered by the then corrupted and obsolete caste system. Today however the situation has gone out of control with more and more reservations promises made and kept by every single government since independence, resulting in the mass rightfully earned justice to the lower castes elevating them socio-economically but leaving the other rather larger part of the population to suffer from lack of better education, or very highly paid universities and in the ever-growing and complex competitive employment market, with fewer jobs and benefits thus far pushing them downwards.   Here's a question for those who argue that the caste system is a cause for poverty in India,   WHY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DID NOT COMPLETELY ABOLISH THE CAST SYSTEM?  They did contribue to stop the child maraiges and the selfish SATI system which forced the young widows to be burnt alive on the pyres of their much older husbands. Then again conspiracy theorists might claim that this served their purpose of keeping the population under control as far as the child maraiges were concerned. No conspiracy theorists can deny that banning the SATI practice was indeed a good action.  They did not ban the caste system but completely embraced it as they were to gain so much more from the divided subconscious of the region than otherwise. Also it was a concept familiar to the British nobility when you think about it.  The issue in hand has a surprisingly simple solution, to completely abolish discrimination on the basis of religion and castes, be it a positive or negative discrimination, and opt for a new system of revenue or income based system that would define, determine, and quantify poverty. To continue with the current model means throwing money into the dark expecting that it reaches those who need it the most.   3) by the time the British left India, we already had a war with the neighbours, on the badly conceived boundaries, sure the Indian and Pakistani emerging governments could have sat down on the negotiating table a bit longer whence the British were still there, but that would mean placing the long awaited and fought for independence in the 1950's which was unacceptable given the above mentioned facts of the outcome of the 2nd World War on the subcontinent. Then the two new nations would witness the biggest and the bloodiest human migration till date on the planet on both sides of the country. One can only fathom the efforts that the two new nations, India and Pakistan had to go through to accommodate the refugees, considering the recent developments of Brexit, the withdrawal of the armed forces from Afghanistan and so many more climate change refugees that we as a planet would face in the future. Of course this would hinder the economy, and infrastructure and industrialization could wait for there were more mouths to feed than what the two new countries could produce. A slow start for any economic development we must agree.  4) there is a big elephant to be addressed in the room, which hovers above the Indian administration as a moon sized inflatable balloon. CORRUPTION. This might have been the case before independence, the psyche of the fes indian entrepreneurs who were in the good books of England, who as correctly explained in the video would hold on to power as far as the development of the country post indepence goes, ignoring the disparity and the ridged distribution of wealth has been the most important factor that hinders economic development. Not unlike the British colonies in Africa. Power and wealth are the two things that enable the greedy to hold on to it, and please do not come around saying that it does not exist in the developed nations, it does, but it is called lobbying which in its own right is the mildew that settled down upon the democratic system from its conception and keeps rotting the fruits of the labour of hundreds of millions across the globe. It is just that in the underdeveloped nations or the ones still in the process the end result is not just visible through wikileaks but we can see it on the ground. Amount of money deployed for infrastructure versus the outcome. In the developed nations it is less visible. We should take a look at the Scandinavian countries where the government is held accountable and every tax payer's penny or paisa in this case is traceable. There are only two sustainable ways out of corruption, transparency like the Scandinavian countries, or anarchy and revolution as the French did by cutting off the heads of the state, literally.  5) the video highlights the cultural, lingual and regional diversity of the country but does not take into consideration the cost of running the biggest (flawed yes but the biggest) democracy in the world. Try being a parent to 29 children who all have different needs, different capabilities, and different ways of doing things. You would want to establish the ground rules applicable to everyone, but there has to be a good amount of liberties given to every individual child to find their passion and be successful in their endeavours, which might seem difficult for you as a parent given that you might not share the same politics and opinions as them. The United States is a prime example of what what happens when there is a tug of war between the state and the government. India is no different, and has the added disadvantage of political extremism just like the states. We too have our green states and our orange states. The reason why it is so much more complicated to achieve progress in India is because of the nonsensically large population. India being a democracy we cannot afford to lower the population by force like China did, of course  did it in the 80's but did not succeed.  Overall, given the circumstances and the heavy duty of the government, I think we are starting to grab the bull by its horns, but we are not even close to eradicate poverty but at least we have a start.

Marx claimed a country must go through the capitalist stage before building socialism.  However, even though Mao's attempts at industrialization failed, Mao did manage to centralize power, build a powerful defense, suppress religious blocks on progress, while educating his people to a high level. Which meant by the 80s China could embrace capitalism in a strong position.  Whereas India went down the mixed economy democratic route. Which doesn't achieve much in a Third World context.  Democracy. like socialism, is a stage that only comes following industrialization. and the creation of a proletariat.  South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore. Hong Kong did not develop under universal suffrage, in fact no country has.  India seems on a par with other Third World countries that have tried to emulate the Western political model too soon. Countries locked in stagnation, and  corruption such as Venezuela,   Lebanon. South Africa, the Philippines etc   Never mind the command economy not working in India, democracy hasn't worked any better. Sure India can be proud of being the World's largest democracy, but it hasn't much to show for it.  Democracy probably being a luxury of the richest countries.  When you're rushing hard to catch up, you really haven'y got the time to argue.  it's like Stalin said 'we are 50 to 100 years behind the advanced nations; we must make good that distance in ten years; Either we do it, or they will crush us.\""  Sure that came at enormous human cost, but the costs of not achieving it, would've been much greater.",1,0

The British, despite their shortcomings, left India in the 1940's. Since then, India has done nothing to improve the life of it's people. Those at the top have ensured they stay there. The second Wold War only lasted 6 years, and the U.K. was severely damaged, all it's Major Cities destroyed, it was, in effect 'Bankrupt' Owing many billions to their so called  ''Friends'' the Americans. Who only lent money and supplied equipment, on the understanding that the U.K. trade routs were opened to the U.S.A.  It took the U.K. nearly 70 years to pay back the money they owed the U.S.A. But pay back they did, and re developed their Economy. They had a co-coalition Government to get them through the War years, then elections (Fair elections, not like the ones in India !) and had a stable Government to start rebuilding the U.K. it is totally wrong to blame the British for India's lack of progress because of Indian troops fighting for the British, and Indian factories helping the War effort. The British factories had to do the same, but after the War went back as before.  Indians fought with distinction throughout the world, but India was not bombed to the extent that the U.K. was, or invaded. So after the War it had every opportunity to rise up and  help in the reconstruction going on everywhere in Europe. Why didn't it? because they were fighting amongst themselves, which ended up in splitting the Country in  1948. Don't blame the British for that either, as it was the only solution to the hate between the two main fractions. It seems to me that the Indian population blame the British for everything, yet the British developed India(Albeit for their own benefit) but when they left it the Indians they left it with good Government Systems, experienced people who could have taken it over for the whole of India's benefit. But as said previously, there is too much corruption, it is rife, no end it sight, it will always be a non Developing Country.

The self-interest of the elite class has been mentioned through the whole video, but never offer a solution or even suggestion. In fact it is the weak point of India manufacturing industry. The elite is holding back the society to fit into the modern manufacture system.  The education, caste, medical, nutritious problem that mentioned, is not the cause but a react of elite monopoly in self-interest. China faced an even worst situation compare to India back in the 19th century. They too give numerous tried on industrialization with very limited result gained.   The situation changed after Mao and CCP smashed the elite gentry classes, liberated the vitality of people with land reforming and even the notorious cultural revolution. Soon literacy rate increased tremendously and farmer become organized, that when USSR industrialize aid came, the China society was ready to adopt it.  There are sequence for industrialization, but India seems to have taken the shortcut every time. India achieved its independence peacefully, lucky for the nation while losing their chance of suppressing the localism once and for all.   The establishment of law and order was too rush before the social reform even started, denuded the necessary violence needed in social reform. The window period allowed the elite to put their interest between the lines of law and make it the frame of national system, which is impossible to be detach in the future.  Today, while Indian despise the revolution of Mao, they indeed in need of the social revolution the most, something that you just can't get around.",2,1

India had to struggled with its inherent problems, which were exacerbated by the plundering and destruction of its British masters, to reach the modest economy that it has now. But India now is making another big mistake by aligning with the warmongering USA against China. The US government is only interested in using India to maintain US supremacy and primacy, and the profits of its military-industrial complex and Big Corporations. So India becomes a sucker to selfish US geopolitical power games, like Australia, and will be spending big on US military hardware, over an imaginary enemy, China, instilled through Western MSM, Big Tech and the US military-industrial complex. Looks like Indians and the Indian leadership have not learned anything from its colonial history!

4893,2021-10-22T03:26:57Z,@observingrogue7652,"Governments really need to die, they are the problem. People need to force government out of their lives, replacing them with personal responsibility and independence, at the level of the individual. No ruling class at all.  The more of your life someone else is responsible for, the more of your life they own. This means they can easily degrade or take your life, with their own incompetence, biases, and greed.  India was so close. Individuals could have focused on what they were good at, and sold those skills & products themselves, to other Indians, or foreigners. But after the British left, India still had rulers. Incompetent, biased, greedy rulers.  And people still had faith & obedience for them.  If someone is a screw-up, then they only screw-up their own lives. But if that someone is responsible for and controlling other lives, then those lives will fail with them, unless someone else intervenes, even if its them saving themselves from the screwed-up one.  What every individual, group, company, country and planet needs, is pure Capitalism and a Meritocracy.  You only have what you EARN, or what is gifted to you. You deserve nothing else beyond that.  Under pure Capitalism, the best of humanity, the strongest, wisest, most skilled, most driven, and the best risk-takers, survive & thrive, while the weak, idiotic, incompetent, lazy, and over cowardly die off, like some form of Darwinism.  But under Socialism & Communism, everyone suffers, everyone dies. The best of humanity working themselves to death, to support themselves AND everyone else through taxes and other parasitic things, or they are punished & killed for trying to get out of this unfair system. Then businesses die next, because they only have lower quality people to work for them, leading to lower quality products & services. Then the parasites, those who live off of welfare and contribute little to nothing to society, they die off, because there is no one for them to live off of.  All this is accelerated, when enough people realize, \""why work hard or at all, when I'm guarantee food, shelter, healthcare, and cash?\"", and, \"" Why work hard or at all, when the more I earn, the more is taken from me through taxes, and other thefts & bullying?\""  Then, finally, the ruling classes dies off, with no one left for them to parasite off of, them eating each other, or starving to death.  I believe this is how socialism & communism guarantees a slow, miserable death for everyone, in isolation, when there is no other person, group, country, or planet to parasite off of.  Yes, in pure Capitalism or a Meritocracy. Many may die, left behind by the best, but please tell me how is that a problem. If you contribute little to nothing to humanity, then why should humanity help you?  If you have no product or service to sell, even your own labor & time, just want to live off the efforts of others, then why should you live?  Why should I help you, when you cannot or will not help yourself?  Prostitutes, models, people acting as guinea pigs for science, and professional speakers should know, that you don't even need to move, to earn money and be valuable...but some people are just too lazy & entitled to even do any jobs like these, and just want things given to them, and are quick to want  some authority like a government to force resources & labor out of good people, through software, intimidation & violence.   And government is happy to steal money from others, because they get a cut of it. Any excuse to take, even claiming to help others with it, even when that is not charity, that is theft & slavery, we have no say who is helped or funded with our stolen taxes, and those individuals or bailed out companies may not deserve anyone's help in the first place, because of how bad they are.  Socialism & Communism are not only broken, are not only unfair, but are fundamentally unsustainable. I don't understand how anyone can want these systems, unless they are an entitled, short sighted fool, who doesn't know history, any economics, or, they are someone who just enjoys the mass suffering & cheating of innocent people & businesses.",0,0

India needs its own indigenous model. Earlier complete socialism and Complete Capitalist model both are not suited for India. Govt should maintain ownership of Companies but manage it strictly professionally to earn more profit same time allow private companies to compete govt owned companies. At present also in petroleum sector Govt owned companies making profits by competing private companies (Indian and International) The motive should be to earn profit only not to control that sector. By doing so this extra profit can be use to boost infrastructure in tier 2,3 towns without increasing Taxes that will benifit economy. The States should be encouraged for business friendly environment by allowing them to decide tax structure and local employment. In this regard GST is not useful as States are not allowed to decide tax structure same time if local employment is not guaranteed why any State Government will bother to develop business friendly environment. Any State Government will interested to attract buisness if employment to local people are ensured so that they will get benifit In election. State Government will compete for attracting buisness for as  local employment guaranteed, they will reduce taxes for voluntarily, the permission will be given smoothly and land acquisition will be easier if local government is involved. This way industries will opened up in least developed States  and small towns will develop. Big City models like western world (apart from Germany) is not beneficial (as we see in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad etc urban infrastructure is not able to handle continuous influx of people). In this context German model by developing small but strong industries in small town can be useful. This way population dependency on farming will reduce we can introduce  machinary , mechanical farming without  upsetting local farm base labour force as they get job in nearby towns. In Short to stay healthy diet is needed but every persons diet is different we can't just copy healthy diet of another person, , same way changes needed but we can't use economic model of other countries to our country.",0,0

It had a large population, and since most of the world was agricultural, it stood out as a giant. Some despots made impressive monuments for dead people, but that is hardly an endorsement of the conditions of the living!  Then the Industrial Revolution happened and the rest just zoomed past. And even before this, the primarily agricultural nature of the economy and the feudal structure of society meant that people were mostly dirt poor.   Please stop feeding this myth that ordinary Indian people have somehow been robbed off their wealth by the British. They - the ordinary people - had no wealth the British could possibly loot, because of which they often supported the onset of British administration - why - because they had a policy of not letting troops live off the land, which meant no arbitrary seizures and practically no looting. For the ordinary Indian person, in the beginning at least, British rule was met with a sigh of relief. The unbeatable command which the EIC had on international trade meant that those parts of India which were under EIC control zoomed ahead from others; something carried through to the present.   At the dawn of the 20th century, India under British control was the most industrialized territory in all Asia, yes, even more than Japan and China combined!

The British were initially defeated and the black hole tragedy happened in Fort Williams. But, under the leadership of Robert Clive a contingent of British soldiers were sent from Madras to Bengal to help the British officials who were successful to flea Fort Williams . Clive bribed one of the corrupt military general Mir Jafar to not participate in the battle. So, it wasn't a battle to be honest , cause the lion's share of the soldiers was controlled by Mir Jafar. Later, the British made Mir Jafar as the puppet king. And since Bengal was the richest state then and it was fallen, the British got a significant advantage over the other competing powers.",48,2

4986,2021-10-18T03:35:06Z,@ronaldwang9838,"Too many factors! To sum up, the three major factors can include all other factors. The cost of re-location of industrial production labor is too high (does the national land policy guarantee the land and housing of industrialized production labor families to reduce labor re-location costs), and the non-single market (the relevant local laws and regulations and everything related to business are intricate and complicated), and lack a large and complete chemical industry and steel metallurgical industry foundation.  New Chinas land reform and land policies ensured that farmers have land and houses and are not allowed to buy or sell them (if allowed, it is easy for the poor to sell their land and houses for a little benefit, and the result is they become even poorer!), which guarantees that in industrialization, the cost of re-settlement of labor is low, because the old and the weak in the hometown (women may also go out to work) and children no longer need re-settlement, and the cost of living in the hometown is low, which is more important than the labor cost itself. India does not have this condition and has not resolved the land issue.  A single market refers to a single set of laws, one set of taxation systems, one set of business rules, one language, almost the same market strategy, and low cost.  China is the world's largest single market.  India is a country but not a single market. It is composed of 35 federal regions. In addition to the basic constitution, the laws of each state are different. In addition to the 22 languages stipulated in the constitution, a total of 121 languages are used by more than 10,000 people.  With the caste system, many Indians cannot even be called \""people\"".  All these are called \""India in bulk\"".  The huge and complete chemical industry and steel metallurgy industry are the foundation of all manufacturing industries. All raw materials for manufacturing are inseparable from the two major industrial products of steel metallurgy and chemical industry. It can determine whether the manufacturing industry chain ecology is good and whether the cost is low. For example, in recent years, many of China's clothing and hats processing industries have moved to Vietnam, but the textile dyes it relies on are chemical by-products. Vietnam cannot solve it. It must rely on a large chemical country like China.  One more thing, all the best national assets of India are still in process of British East India Company.  India does not own the capital necessary to complete industrialization.  Foreign capital only pays attention to profit, and will not help complete Indias industrialization in accordance with Indias intentions.",2,2

If one VIRTUAL Indian-nation would rise in economical might, it could offer support to lesser successful ones. Normally, people from poor countries want to emigrate to wealthier ones; this time you create the same effect, but within the same country. Of course, you do keep one military might.   My love to all my Indian brothers and sisters, I've walked through your beautiful country. I wish you all the prosperity in the world.",1,2

We may talk a lot about it but we are not really sure on how it really will affect the planet- It seems though that India is one of the countries that risk getting a bad hand there. The glaciers that feed the Indian rivers are shrinking and the monsoons could change directions so it is impossible to say what the effects will be but it will likely be a problem.  Southern China have the same problem, while Russia actually might get a good deal with more land in Siberia becoming possible to live off as well as the trade route in the arctic opening up.  I don't claim I know how bad things will get, maybe just annoying or maybe really bad but it will affect the world economy. Countries far up north (and Chile) will likely get benefits from a warmer climate even if higher sea levels can be a problem for them as well. So I would say it is an unknown factor that might make things worse for India.  Not doomsday worse, earth was far warmer 150 million years ago with more then twice the current CO2 levels but raising sea levels and shifting monsoon winds will impact agriculture. Of course plants like more CO2 so the exact impact is hard to say.  India's government does not seem like one who can adapt well to changing situations and that is worrying.",0,0

Blames the Indian government for owning the steel factories?  So did China!  China has 56 ethnic minorities but the Chinese government emphases unity and harmony whereas democracy by its nature has to tribalize people and create (even manufacture) differences to get votes.  India can't just blame the British rule - They are independent in 1948,  the current Chinese government was set up in 1949.  The Communist China was under massive sanction for decades, thus even more disadvantaged compared to India.  The Indian elites control power?  I thought democracy is supposed to work and the people would vote them out!  What happen to democracy in India? It didn't work for 70 years!  China and India are neighbors, similar in population and land mass.  Both got independent from foreign powers in roughly the same time.   The video did blame the ineffective government policies.  So you need a better explanation.  My explanation would be the contrast between the Chinese government policy and India's.  For the Chinese government to open up the country to foreign investment in the 1980s, this is an extremely bold policy for a Chinese population who are educated since primary school about the shame of foreign subjugation of China.  The Chinese government mitigated the risk by requiring foreign investment to establish joint venture companies with only 49% share.  What would Indians react to such policy if this is implemented in India? I would say one candidate would have attacked the other for betraying India to foreign power once again and the people wouldn't have voted for the person.",3,1

They were being told that they can grow more, faster and better with special seeds  (that you have to buy every time from monsanto) and other products. In the end it turned out to be so bad and so much less profitable and ecological, that Monsanto was banned from India altogether. And now finally they have found a way to revolutionize their agriculture, with simple things like agroforesting, which basicly does all that monsanto was pretending their products would. Crops grow faster, farmers have almost 4 times the income and also they help recovering the damage ecosystems in India, like depleated soil from bad farming and the monsanto damage, air pollution due to lack of trees and other things.",3,0
5134,2021-10-06T01:58:49Z,@kaceobrwa7039,"1.India is poor because it has 2 nuclear enemies next to its border unlike some other country, india spends roughly 70 B dollars every year for defence , this is the reason why Pakistan is also a poor country , because they have to spend more percent of their GDP to counter indian defence budget and as for china , during great leap forward roughly 15 to 55 million Chinese died , but the news of this came after 20 years , now if you want to live in this country , go live  2. India has huge population, unlike small countries with high GDP per capitan like Qatar , Luxembourg etc india can never became high income country , because of its huge population, even china can never became high income country, and both of these countries know this  3. Thoughts about money in india vs other country , if you see minds of indian people on money, they treat monney as just a tool for financial security, in india , take case of Buddha , he had everything but he left it , and went on in search of truth , now you find this trait in most of the indian people , they don't really care about money that much as compared with other people , that's why india has one of the highest saving rate because people don't really spend much here, you can get food very easily in india  4. Nehruvian socialism, if you check the history bof world economics by Angus Maddison India was the richest country in the world for more than 1500 years , from 1 AD to 1500 AD , with pretty good GDP per capita in first millennia , so I don't know what your \""india is still poor mean\"" , anyways india is now poor indian economy is slow and big it's like elephant",1,5

5148,2021-10-03T16:02:57Z,@MrPoornakumar,"The major trend or theme is good. Obseravtions are good. But conclusions are highly debatable, sentence by sentence.  In India we are all in it for the fun of it. We are interested growing to a level where it can trade with all countries on equal basis. We don't know how to work or rather prevented from it. The same Indians go abroad, being incentivised would love to work hard. They strive to enhance the wealth of their host countries (this isn't my opinion alone, but the world says it) many-fold. We in the country envy them, but can't do a thing about it. It implies that there is a serious flaw in (age-old) social structure here. If possible (?) this needs to be addressed & remedied, however harsh it may be. Seemingly here, there is no apparent respect for \""work\"".I can not even quantify work in india  Your last conclusion is debatable. First, China is sitting on an Empire that she inherited with all its trappings of Economic exploitation. The secret of her succes is America. America hived off all her industry to China where daily necessities can be \""made\"" at a tenth of production cost in own country. It is an arrangement where it is \""win-win\"" sitaution for both. Unemployment problem in China got solved 100%. That industrialised China beyond expectations & way beyond the reach of Asian tigers. It made necessities (daily) available to Americans far cheaper, keeping the Electorate happy & contented. In the bargain China built up wealth (forced savings) to an extent (because meeting all daily necessities -numbering in thousands- of Americans is lucrative business, way above) where she ploughed back US$ 2 Trillion profits in American industry, to gain control over that Economy (keeping the standard of living of her workers abysmally low, devoid of any Labour rights). America has more of all resources, for her to prosper without help from outside. In XIX century, she must have grown at annual rate of 8 to 9% in GDP,  doing so, peacefully for a century (with no wars on her soil, except small ones tactically designed to enhance wealth). With this kind of monotonous growth, wealth creation is possble by 10 times in a generation (say, 25 years) & of 4 generations the growth must have been 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 times in economy over a century (1800 to 1899) ! There is no parallel to this. Annual Indian GDP growth from 1900 to 1949 is pegged at 0.05% (under British colonial exploitation). It was so while, peoples in the old world (Eurasia + Africa) were wasting their energy & money, endlessly fighting, exploiting & killing each other. With such Economic base ringing like a bell, there is no way America will take even second place, even if mismanaged (temporarily). Her potential to grow, is worth seeing in the 6 years of WW II, that is a humongous event in human history opening the flood gates for enormous Technological growth, with America in the lead. The seeds for the present day Technology are sown in those six years, that most peope see (one-sided) only as \""fighting\"".

And today China is so extremely successful despite its relatively bad situation in the 1940's. In the era of nations states, India is at a disadvantage. Part of the reason it democracy which really only works well with a unified society, and India has very many very different cultures. The other is that democracy is not nimble. Thus India has two massive disadvantages relative to China. Also another issue with Republic is that those in charge have to only be good at one thing, getting elected, and many times the best liar is the best as getting reelected.",0,0

The wealth of any nation is the some of the interests of the people which are represented in that society, kim jung of north korea is very wealthy as only his interests are represented in north korea, the people may vote for Kim jung but the peoples interests are not represented, kim jungs interests are represented in north korea.

Its like feudalism verses empowering the people, an empowered people are more inventive, and productive than surfs or slaves.",0,0

5414,2021-09-04T14:14:09Z,@Yowise,"Welp... producing food is for poor country. Low development.  Medium development is focused on production things like cars etc. High development has service specialised. A lot of IT workers and things focused on giving service. Low - Africa country Medium - China , India  High - USA , Japan etc.   So focusing only on producing food like creator of video mention... won't really bring high profit.  That's why the type of resource is so important.. Having a lot of coal won't really make u rich nowadays... But having a lot of oil , gold , uran  will do. Same goes to services... Good IT guy gonna be much more profitable and create far more effective systems than poor educated IT guy... So service is needed the most and it cost the most as everyone DEMAND , WANT the best thing.   That's why high developed countries focus on service creating production in other countries in order to grow themselves.   That's my way of understanding it based on own knowledge i heard from school etc..   Ah btw... Country like Japan does protect secret of own products and tend to sell best type of products only for themselves and not really outside. (Domestic focus ) in order to not allow others get same lvl of knowledge like they do about certain thing they produce.   For now everyone is focused on producing cheaper.. cheaper..cheaper to the point of making quality of the product to suffer. But no one really realise it.  Products made in 80's could last for long years...  products made today... sometimes gonna break up in matter of months...   Sure.. selling gonna grow from it.. same demand... but the problem gonna show up from the moment people realise... that resources have limit... like it slowly shows up with electronics and silicon that's missing more and more by doing damage to sector of economy that has need for electronic.  Car industry , AGD , PC ( big crying over prices of new GPUs ) that literally do pause of production line.  You cannot produce anything if u don't have resource for it and... we simply waste resources by producing low quality shit by overly cutting cost to the point of creating too much fragile product and system that can collapse at any moment like some supply lines did in USA when Covid break up. Democratic countries has far more problems with it than for example China.   People always seems to pick the CHEAPEST one instead of a BALANCE between QUALITY and COST... which you can think what may happen soon.... Literally any factory will be more and more not-reliable due to having machines that gonna break itself all the time...  ,because of having product  ( machine) that was been made to cut costs and make the most cheapest product and that machine produce new product that may have some hidden problems... as it was been made by product itself that has unforgiveable cons. No one has determined how do they cut costs... right?  For example using a far more weak quality steel as its cheaper in things like car frame... which make car cheaper itself.. Check Dacia Duster new crash test...  The article on it said : It is far safer to be driven-by that car than be inside it. Everything at the end is about balance... Giving full freedom to economy isn't an good idea either.. same goes to full controlling it.",0,1

Without regulation, Capitalism does not work effectively, as was learned in the aforementioned time periods.

They want to stay in foreign countries for alive, because life in India is very difficult. Many houses in India still don't have toilet. In some areas, one toilet shared by 10 families, or more. In some areas, many families used the river as \""public toilet\"". I have many friends married with foreigners. They proud of it. But, the Indian man look easy to get foreigners woman, compare to Indian woman. Indian woman, like others Asian women, very shy. In many cases, they refuse to take-a-date with foreigners man. They had told to foreigners man; \""If you like me, we just get married. I don't know how to take-a-date\"". But in India, many Indian women, especially who's work in factory and plantation, got the \""secret relationship\"" with the foreign workers from Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, because their husband work in foreign countries, such Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia or Singapore, for long periods (maybe 7 or 10 years). So, that's wife feel very lonely, boring and desperate of sex.

The current government finally passed 3 agricultural reform laws, and the middlemen and rich farmers have held the government hostage for months-- blocking highways into Delhi by camping out on them.

5716,2021-08-28T17:18:18Z,@himanv,"Several whitewashing attempts.  Industrialization didn't happen in India because England ran a mercantile economic system-- India wasn't in charge of its own destiny, it was controlled from London-- London  kept India as a source of raw materials and a market for its end products, fueling that great Industrial Revolution on the island.   Second issue: You assume what was happening in 1750s India was some sort of \""civil war\""-- as in, Indians were united in a national identity, fighting off tyrannical rulers. Not quite. If that were the case, India would have gained independence and remained independent. There was disunity within India, which the British exploited to the hilt.  Biggest issue: The Mughal and Islamist rule over big parts of India in the previous few hundred years before the British came was also extractive and ruinous to the Indian economy and local ways of life and business. The Mughals and before them the Delhi Sultanate had ZERO  loyalty to the land and its people. Instead, they taxed them jiziya and other forms of taxes, and centralized this system toward Delhi (done first by the marauder Alaud-din Khilji almost 700 years ago). These Islamists paid tribute to the Caliphate and also sent large sums of money to their homeland as tribute. Historic accounts are full of large tributes in terms of money and humans (slaves) sent to Bhagdad (then the capital of the Islamic Caliphate), and to places like Samarkand, Fergana, and Bukhara in Central Asia from whence these Turkic marauders first came into India.  Indian economic and educational system was based around large temples that were funded by local rulers, and from where everybody was educated, loans and food was dispersed, etc. The Islamists in their own chronicles of their rule show just how many thousands of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples they broke and built mosques on top. The result wasn't just a breaking of the architecture, but of the economy too.   Therefore, India post-1947 had to not just work on national integration and to build up the industries but also to deal with almost 1000 years of extractive economics' aftermath.   Worst of all, the division of India left Pakistan with a lot of the irrigation systems and fertile Punjab, while saddled India with a truncated Islamist population which has acted as a brake on not just national integration but also on growth-- their ghetto mentality has meant that they have remained one of the lowest achievers on all socioeconomic indicators of progress even though every government in the last 75 years has given them more resources and preferential treatment, in the name of \""secularism\"" and actual appeasement. Remove that 20% which acts like anchors weighing down the Indian ship, and India would progress much faster.  Don't trust me? -- Look up socioeconomic statistics of India.",0,0

But still indian entrepreneurs did not give up and kept in touch. Once the british went away it was still hard as there was hardly any funding available. slowly and surely it started coming back. indian pedigree is unquestionable as you see though they have lagged in hardware they boss in software only next to usa.  the software industry saved india and put it right back on the map!  the google, msft ceo's are from india is a testimony to this and last time I checked they are among top 5 firms in the world.  yes, the japanese, the chinese, the koreans, the russians, the europe: french,uk and the mighty US are still bossing but india is slowly clawing back.  but gone are the days of mine is better than yours attitude. these days you need global collaboration to get it done. does not matter you are first but do better.   example: computer and cell phone and automobile, plane and space materials come from around the world.  Research n Development funds are still very abysmal in india as people dont have money to spare. most of the money goes to their own well being and savings for a rainy day. On top of it there is usual drainage due to malpractice.  the infrastructure needs total overhaul and money needs to be borrowed so that you have clean stuff for next 50 years. did not happen in last 50 years!  but india possesses talent no doubt. But indians are not genetically programmed to work 24/7. it is just not possible in indian set up: lack of real estate, family pressure, personal pressure, huge population etc etc. But still people take pains to venture out and make it happen.  earlier they barely worked 4 hours now it has gone to 6 and soon it will get to 8. this is on top of all wastage.  the main issue is getting in to work takes time. by the time you get off bed and hit work there is 3 hours delay and a huge waste and also 2 hours to come back. so in doing 7 hours work there is 5 to 6 hours wastage. you are not raring to go. by the time you got to office you are jaded!  And lack of  electricity-power means you cant take your work home. there is no 24/7 power ever in india!  and indian families are crowded, noise and distraction galore. culture has lot of festive activities, travel that and this( culture exploration than book exploration, is hard in modern era)  so just pure work culture does not exist and never will unlike a YANKEE n JAP n now CHINESE who wont go home and will bury himself in work for 10 days non stop! why? it is that kind of life.  so efficiency has to increase: just work 4 days but work damn 45 hours! it is followed in some europe nations now--hurried by the pandemic.  But surely you have 2 to 3% of indians quite rich and can give run for any other rich in the world! And it is climbing up as times goes by.  surely in next 20 to 25 years india would be up there with the best in large quantum not just by some pockets( 10 tril economy is the goal). once you get there it is an open field.",1,0

When aids are provided ,people simply abuse them rather than doing what it was given for. government controlling the market simply provides a safer environment for smaller businesses to grow to the point where it can stand independently. It has flaws but they're neccessary to sustain if we dont want to rely on others. india is simply moving forward slowly but it's always moving. it hasn't stopped and it won't the government is made up of smart people who actually do the work, the representatives are the dumb ones and it's fine because they're not the ones who make the policies to begin with. All they do is abuse the sysytem which gives others an example that corruption is good . soo that's the problem . Corruption and education. Once those two sectors will be fixed everything else will be fine however corruption is a big pile of shit to clean as it's an extension of greed and everyone has it especially when you're poor.  soo yeah slow and steady wins the race. India will reach the point of success while slowly removing the flaws. it's already doing so . you called government owned industries to be bad yet isro and drdo , hal are doing great , they are government owned industries you know. this decade will see significant changes in indian economy as the government is focusing on the industries and banks exclusively while removing ways to abuse the aids at lower levels. no middle man will be able to take cuts from the poor's aid money and neither will the poor be able to abuse the aid money by buying drugs and alcohol from it . the moeny will be used for what it was intended to be used for",0,0

6176,2021-08-25T02:53:35Z,@sktskt4701,Sorry Buddy.. India is richer than  USA..  Here are the convincing reasons: 1. Work that costs 13479.63 USD in US costs 539.19 USD in India. Thereby the affordability is cheap so for every 13479 USD that US spends it is sufficient if India spend only 539 USD ( it applies in most of the places ). 2. Since the cost of work is cheaper it increases the affordability of Indians so Indians save more than Americans in their salary. The cost of living is cheaper in India so people don't need to earn like Americans. Eg :  4.13USD  can buy you one toothpaste packet in US and 4 toothpaste packets in India.  So the luxury life affordable by a middle class in India is not affordable by the Middle class man in US.,0,0

A larger population should, and would, have meant greater innovation, which had been the case in pre-British India. The Brits however not only destroyed Indian development that had existed before their arrival, like in the textile industry by cutting off weavers thumbs and destroying their equipment, but also denied India of almost all its basic resources and education. In fact their education system was so horrible it was just meaningless pro British propaganda. So yes I wouldnt recommend information from this channel.

Many research papers points to stability as a main driver for Indias lack of performance.  If a state can provide a minimum of stability, like a stable working law system, basic taxation of businesses and people, some form of basic education, separate religion and politics and a hint of political stability, doesnt even need to be a democracy you get far. If none of these are working, you get nowhere.

Thus for an external power to come and understand finer details of the society is simply not possible. - Thus for day to day governance, Britishers relied on certain nominees from society to engage with them (kings or elites from that area); thus extreme bias in decisions - Further like every imperial power, rarely did Britishers had any genuine intention of bringing about change in the society. Rather status quo in society was beneficial for them, as they had much lower variability in problems they faced. - Access to education was broadly kept limited, and thus people had absolutely no understanding of revolutions happening in the west - India remained in 17th century for 200+ years, while the world moved-on",0,0

Though, I feel over generalization of some the complex scenario's we've had  [Part 1 - 1700s] - When Britishers arrived in India, unfortunately India was in deep-deep decline. Mughals were fading rapidly, new kings were caught in infighting. This was a perfect opportunity for someone with superior understanding of fire arms to conquer the region.  - Education during that time was limited to a very narrow section of the society. While European countries underwent major overhauls in education system during industrial revolution, India further regressed during the same period - Indian Royal class (since 1200s) was focused more towards cultural aspect of education/learning with little orientation towards science and technology. Though, India had a major cultural revolution from 1200s to 1700s with many saints/religions/sects/dharmic movements taking place, a very miniscule progress was made on science and technology front [in extreme contrast to Europe]  - Thus, when Britishers arrived in India with much superior understanding of machines, arms and scientific process, Indian elite class had absolutely no clue how to deal.",18,0

The government focused on those areas of industrialisation which lacked private capital and initiative, always giving preference to private investment where it took the initiative. There was a great deal of FDI as well. By 1967 foreign firms were investing 6309 million INR in India. Governmental intervention in economy was essential for growth. By blending two forms of economic systems the government granted people security, economic and social while allowing enterprise. This joint sector approach was most suited to India emerging from 2 centuries of colonial oppression. Currently, the government has put in place several social security measures including food security to preserve the dignity of the disadvantaged. Are there problems? Yes several. Is there poverty? Absolutely.  However, India is not a poor country. The richest person in Asia is an Indian.

According to the spokesman, in early history, India was, indeed, a very rich country because it had and still have all those useful natural resources. Time have changed and so is India. From a reach country down to a poorest country in the world. How come leh? In my opinion I feel its the managements problem. India is not governed by King but by its Prime Minsters and his MPs. Now let me give you my two cents worth:- firstly, is corruption because once any staff accept under tables money the service or goods you purchased would be compromised. Secondly, India is seldom mix with other countries in other words India is a  Self look after own self. Last but not least, comparable to US, CHINA, EU, UK Taiwan Malaysia Vietnam Indonesia they all welcome foreigners to join their countries as citizens. So far I can many Indians converted into Singaporeans but I couldnt find any Singaporean converted into Indian citizens. WHY? Leh? Because the Indian PM does not know how to manage his country properly. To the Indian PM, sorry if I have hurt your feelings but I just say the truth.",1,0

We have overtaken Russia in terms of economic growth. Some of our States have the GDP of entire countries like Sri Lanka. What you should have done is talk about how the economic growth haven't reached to the masses. Large portion of the population, sadly still has income as low as 30 cents per day. But you also have to take in consideration that we have a ginormous population. We didn't get 200 years of undisturbed growth like the USA did. Also our country is a democratic country.

6734,2021-08-22T06:12:15Z,@odealianaffairs9001,This is my own take but imo i feel like we have the dumbest trade regulations. Im no trade expert but even as a consumer its easy to see how bad it is. There are huge customs and taxes on goods you get from outside. The reason? To promote in-house goods. Heres the kicker tho. Some of these goods just arent available within India (example silicon chips and other electronics ) and even if some are they are years behind their western and Chinese counterparts. Hence every Indian is forced to buy goods at a higher price (practically double in a lot of situations) whilst also earning lesser than the rest of the world on average. This is just as a consumer but I can imagine how bad it sucks for other smaller businesses. This combined with mountains of trade regulations and paperwork and lots of internal fighting makes it a very poor choice for foreign investment and hence the average standard of living is still very bad.  Edit: just watched the full video and I see youve touched on this. However I still dont think its as open as it should be.,5,1

And at this time Europe and the Middle-eastern regions were fighting like hell. And the technology used to be transferred very quick among the region.

Yet economists would dismiss that claim based upon the fact that the rise of the US economy did not come from trade with other countries. It was actually due to the creation, in the latter half of the 19th century, of a vast market without barriers to trade WITHIN THE BOARDERS OF UNITED STATES ITSELF. Steel from Pittsburg built railroads crisscrossing the nation so that apricots from California could travel thousands of miles to market in Indiana, cotton from Alabama could be used to manufacture clothing in New England, and cattle from Texas could be shipped to feedlots in Chicago, where it was fattened with corn from Nebraska, then butchered and packed off to New York to feed millions of immigrants arriving from Europe. THAT was how America became rich. Furthermore, this was during a period when American was actually very inward looking and isolationist. It was only much later and well into the 20th century that the American economy became significantly intertwined with the economies and politics other countries. Furthermore, and contrary to what this video implies, India didn't make some sort of virtuous choice not to follow the bad example of the US \""going to war\"" in order to trade with other countries. Again, America DID NOT become wealthy through trade with other countries. The American model would have been for India to start by creating a large free market within its own boarders through working to dismantle internal barriers to trade. But India did just the opposite. It strangled its home market with a command economy. And the reason India did that was actually pretty dark: India was trying to gain favor with the communist block post World War II by aligning itself, politically and economically, with USSR. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in particular took India down that path in a cynical effort to use the cold war fears to gain an advantage by playing the US and Soviets against each other. Remember India touting itself as the leader of \""league of non-aligned nations\"" (a group of countries that actually aligned their UN voting record almost exactly with that of the USSR)? It was this opportunistic and stupid policy that resulted in, among other bad outcomes, an almost criminal mismanagement of Indian's economy.",0,0

Even today, that stands, with the Indian rich and middle class being almost entirely from the \""elites\"", continuously propagating their privilege structurally through caste networks, incomprehensible laws and justice system and bureaucrats and law enforcement either being of the elites themselves or in their pockets for crumbs, ensuring that they have pretty much the entire pie.

But for every \""truth\"" you speak of there is a good counter example. So maybe those truth aren't truth and things are actually a little more complicated than \""liberalism always work\"". Let's get into details, you explain how important sectors of the economy work way better under liberalism rule. So how do you exaplin railroads in the UK or Health in the USA are way worse than in countries where it's part of the public sector (France, Sweden) ? \""Centralized economy can't produce good quality goods\"", yeah right, what about ak-47 and Soyuz spacecrafts ? Designed in the 60s and still widely used today. \""There is something called comparative advantages and india should have invested and specialised in its agriculture\"". You do know that this theory is like 2 hundred years old and seem to just not work for nations ? Like every powerful economy today seem to be a complex economy that doesn't really specialize in anything (more exactly, it produces everything it can produce, as you said, the UK and Japan can't grow crops, so they do what they can but have to import some) while poor economy are simple economies that only produces 2 or 3 things and specialize in it. According to Ricardo the poor countries should be rich, but they aren't so something must not be working that way (and it doesn't because the world is way more complex than just 2 countries exchanging wine and wool).  I'm not saying every argument you propose is necessarily wrong or that centralized economy always work. But there are multiple examples where it did work (even in the soviet union). Also there are gazillions examples of liberalism actually maintaining poverty in a country (take like every country in africa for example). So what i'm saying is things are probably more complex than that and you should at least try to give some perspective about things by actually looking at historical events.",1,0

Yes, both countries are surviving old civilization. China went through the communist revolution in the 40's and the culture revolution in the 60's. These two revolutions destroyed feudalistic relics that included social classes. The status of working class and women were elevated. This laid a foundation for the rapid economic development of China. In India, over 90% of the people still live in a feudalistic society where personal bondage (or slavery) is still practiced.  Only about 10% of Indians live in modern society. The two societies coexist and are relatively independent. There is not simply a culture base for a modern India.",0,0

7320,2021-08-19T03:16:14Z,@webabhi,"I'll give you four reasons 1) India didn't start well as a country. In 1951 it had a life expectancy of 32 years and a literacy rate of 12%. Even Goa which has a literacy rate of 90% and PCI PPP of 22,000 US $ today had a literacy rate of 37% in 1961 when it was liberated by India from Portuguese rule. 2) India became a socialist democracy from 1947 to 1991. 3) India also struggled to control its population and took 30 years to significant reduce its fertility rate. On the other hand China took only 7 years to control its population due to the one child policy. This means that India in 1990s should have had twice the GDP growth rate of China to catch up with China. If China had 10% GDP growth then India should have had 20% GDP growth. Many smaller countries like Thailand, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh which followed India's model of family planning were able to take 20 years to control their population owing to their smaller size and lesser diversity. 4) India is too diverse with many religions, ethnicities, castes, groups, tribes and clans. It is 10 times bigger than Yugoslavia and 15 times more diverse. In such a society decision making takes time and decisions taken are not necessary the best. For example India struggled to implement GST and is currently struggling to implement agriculture reform laws.",14,0

It may be the case that Nordic countries, which is where I believe the narrator of this video is from, takes the best of capitalism and socialism to create a \""fair\"" and balanced, functioning economy that doesn't happen in a lot of countries where capitalism is the economic system.   In countries like the US and UK the elites also have the politicians in their pockets, they are often the same people and if not their election campaigns are funded by them so their wealth and prospects are intertwined. Also companies in these countries seek to create a monopoly by either buying up competitors that pose a threat to them or subsidise their products for enough time to put their competitors out of business. This sounds very similar to what was described about the Indian licensing system that allowed existing monopolies to keep their hold on power albeit in a different guise.   I do agree that government wouldn't be controlling all but the most vital of industries, like healthcare, education, policing, and basic public utilities, and should only be setting regulations for others to allow safety and a level playing field for all entrants into the free market, but that's not happening in nearly all of the world. The problem is that India is playing catch-up, it can't do what China has done because it isn't a communist, state controlled country, but if it opened up completely to the developed world what would happen is just what happened in the former Communist Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union after the fall of communism where foreign competitors just either outcompeted or bought up and closed down companies, or these companies were handed to existing elites to create oligarchs, in a garage sale type scramble.   There has to be a transitional period, however those in power make more money and consolidate their own wealth and power from just selling everything off to their rich friends so either the current systems remain or chaos reigns with exploitation and almost looting of a country's assets overnight, both of which just aren't very welcome.",1,0

The United States did not enter World War II  against Japan or Germany to increase trade.  Yes, the U.S. has used its military to pry open new markets, perhaps in China.  The United States became the wealthiest, most powerful country in the history of the world by adopting true free-market Capitalism.  India went the Socialist route, which is why it was poor for so long.  Now India is trying to adopt a more Capitalist economic model and as a result, India is becoming more wealthy.  The next step involves eliminating the suffocating government bureaucracy (not to mention corruption) that destroys the forward momentum of the Indian economic system.",1,0

Its easy to introduce wrong policies but very difficult to get rid of them ..because of wrong policies some people gain power and have massive sway in democracy .. to remove them becomes very difficult ..like farm laws will help farmers massively ..but because middle man have gained lots of power by keeping farmers poor and earning from agriculture they are using all there power to stop it .. thats y you see lots of protest of farmers ..as they are misguided .. if india wants to develop it needs more freedom not less .. infact any country does .. china was successful because it gave more freedom in deng shao ping era .. in embraced more of capitalism and lots of freedom in every scope .. but things are changing now ..its reverting back to old days in Xi's rule.. china  is at crossroad where if it want more development  it needs democracy and CCP is resisting it .. no communist country will ever be truly developed country .. for initial phase communism (or dictatorship ) may be faster then democracies as they can implement reforms faster ..but as people become richer they want more freedoms and more power ...which communist country will never be willing to share .. in the end either they will become democratic or double down  on communism and destroy all the development they have gained ...,1,0

What would have been really interesting is if you had added a fourth model - the one implemented by Deng Xaioping in China. I realise that this model was not available until decades later. But the idea of India implementing a thorough land reform followed by the growth of private cultivation as part of a state plan is intriguing. This would have solved the food shortage in India and provided the farmers with sufficient income to lay the basis for the growth of light industry and consumer manufacture. Leading onto heavier industry in due course. This was the way forward for India - building first on its potential strengths in labour intensive agriculture and then moving onto other sectors organically. Sadly, the Soviet model of agricultural collectivisation and heavy industry never worked well in China or in the many African countries where it was tried.",21,1

But not enough is said about the massive plunder economically from 1856 to 1947. Changing from almost 24 % of world GDP to less than 4% in 250 years that was directly transferred to finance the industrial revolution in the uk.    You touch on lack of innovation during the 1800s leading to economic stagnation. But some more context is needed here.  The British empire literally deindustrialed many industries and forced Indian consumers to buy British goods through import at highly inflated prices. One example is when the east India company chopped of hands of highly skilled textile workers (making cotton that was prized by European dressmakers in the 1800s).,7,2

Keep in mind that india has the 4th largest foreign reserves in the world, it is one of the largest economies in the world and has one of the most powerful armies in the world.  Unfortunately, dirty politics in a democracy means that development is halted. An example of this is:  if one government is controlling a state and are towards the end of their rule, they will completely halt any development because it should be the other government's headache.  Also, India is run by goons and uneducated people. None of the cabinet of ministers are even educated enough to understand the absolute basics of their own ministry.  Finally, several of India's people destroy it internally. The gazwa-e-hind model believes in complete annihilation of hindus. People feel insecure about anything that's happening now but won't bat an eye over horrible events such as the kashmir massacres of kashmiri hindus in the 1990s.",0,0

7694,2021-08-16T21:04:21Z,@dfherr86,"There are some important considerations that were omitted about Indian independence. The entire nations infrastructure was designed to be extractive of raw goods. The Delhi Famine being the best example. The food grown in the interior was put on the only railroad out of Delhi, constantly creating food insecurity. When that stopped happening it also created and economic crisis. India had Indians to feed, but no part of the macro economics was designed for an independent India with it all integrated.  A Command economy in an of itself is not a huge burden when you are starting from zero. As things get more complex it becomes more and more inefficient. Having a public-private partnership with the landlords and other elite middlemen would have worked better. Creating national prices for commodities would have been smart. Then it would allow for \""transaction fees\"" and other economic rents by the elites instead. Also the federal government buying them out over time would have really helped with the logistics problem. All of that pales in comparison to the impact the lack of urbanization had.  \""India is a nation of villages\"" according to Gandhi. We know from the Chinese example that turning small cities into major ones has the most positive impact for creating a higher value domestic product. If India created enclaves of free trade like Hong Kong to then make sister cities, it could have went a long way. The huge port cities could have been a great first step. Then connect them with rail and roads. Allow for tariff free trade inside the free trade zones so that the parts that were needed could get assembled.  It would certainly be possible doing all that during the cold war. The government dictating prices allows for foreign imports of complicated or refined goods. Allows for fertilizers, tractors, and trucks. If every major region had a value chain to the sea they could have beaten China to the punch as the worlds factory.",37,1

Britain modernized India with machinery when Britain was one of the few countries that could make cast iron machine tools.  Its complete nonsense to say India was a peaceful rich country before the British.

7876,2021-08-16T08:01:19Z,@Akira-dc7is,The problem with india is what china started doing say 20 to 30 years ago we are doing it now. With time we will catch up to the world in 2 to 3 decades but those important years will never come back. Another big issue is the people themselves. Because most of the poor people are uneducated they dont really understand government policies or other schemes. Hence they are easily manipulated into thinking whatever some political party wants them to think. Recently the govt released farm laws which would help the farmers but the opposition party manipulated their ignorance into thinking they are bad for them. Just so that they can make the govt look bad.  Whenever a bill or any order is passed it takes forever to be implemented because these politicians or any other group  keep hindering the process. This causes delays and makes us fall backwards.,0,0

Most opinions on this matter are incredibly one sided and can fall into one of two main categories: (1).'The British ruined everything and it is impossible for India to possibly recover from them'. If it's not that, then it's (2).'Indians are just too incompetent because of their culture or religion'. Both of these claims fail to see the greater issues here and show an obvious bias against the Indian people as a whole. The first opinion is more subtle, yet still biased against Indians because it implies that Indians are not capable of building a nation from poverty to promise like the peoples of other colonized nations can, or nations that have experienced significant conflict. The second opinion is an obvious bias that doesn't need much explanation, but is equally as common from what I've seen. This video explains the true economic nuance of the situation and why it's so depressing how a government that intended for equality and the best for everyone was offset by future global economic trends, internal corruption and just ignorance on the half of a few people in powerful places, but that's all it takes,",112,129

7909,2021-08-16T01:56:49Z,@arcsaber1127,"Funny thing is, the further back you go in time, the more developed India was compared to the rest of the world. Considering it had about 33% of the world's GDP, and gave rise to such inventions as zero as a number and our decimal number system that basically the world of today is built upon. It also influenced the cultures of the entirety of east and south east Asia, and attracted students to its universities like Taxila and Nalanda from as far away as Persia and Japan Yes things went downhill after the muslim invasions, and just as India was recovering from that through the Maratha empire, the EEC took over.  But the reason why India is poor today is because it's social structure has been uprooted. In the traditional structure, everybody had their place and role; there being the artisans, tillers, entrepreneurs, warriors, and the intellectuals who guided the kings and society as a whole. This helped maintain stability and morality. Post muslim invasions and especially after the EEC, this order was disrupted and it led to the less educated getting as much a say in society as the intellectuals, especially through voting rights. This is something the unscrupulous politicians take advantage of to their own benefit.  But this disruption may be for the better; now instead of a group of people, everybody has to learn the importance of action, morality and consequence. It will be a difficult road which is what India is seeing right now, but difficult times make strong people so if India can survive these times it will emerge much better for it",8,4

Well if you truly call yourself a historian then you would know it was the British colonist policies that prevented India to industrialise. In fact, they de-industrialized India  Also regarding why India remains closed was also because of the insecurity of being getting colonised again. Because it was the open trade with east India company that costed India its political power to Britain  Also, India is poor because the West is rich. Read dependency theory",3,7
