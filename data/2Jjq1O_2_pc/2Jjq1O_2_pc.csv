Only 2% of the central government's budget is for education, but in addition most states generally give 9-10% towards education. Some more and some less.   In any case even this is inadequate, but you failed to mention this nuance",0,0

It's sad to see only one aspect of any parameter is made to show a grim picture, whereas the mirroring aspect can get much show otherwise. Eg: it shows % of GDP spent on healthcare, but it has not recognised purchasing power parity of India. How else did we build the infrastructure against COVID, and how else is India a leader in telemedicine and medical tourism. The content creator has merely concluded that India's economy is in dire straits and has misrepresented facts to justify three assumption. It's true the economy has struggled so far, but one cannot compare India's growth linearly with China. I see this content is 9 months old, and as on Q2 reports India's is the fact getting major economy, faster than China's.

20,2023-11-25T08:31:12Z,@challenger539,"This video is one of the few ones who focused on the fundamental problems of our country's growth stagnation since last 75 years. One of the most challenging aspect I believe along with the expenditure part in HDI is the obstacle provided by India's model of fiscal federalism. Many scholars argued it to be contradictory and inefficient. Like we have 1 Central board for education- CBSE but also different decentralized boards of all the states. This produces a major flaw- if central government brings any reforms or policies or projects it will be only applicable for CBSE, ICSE board may follow and  state boards as per their wish. So there is no space for uniformity in growth. Same goes for healthcare. There's a central ministry of HDI who can invest building mega-med colleges like AIIMS or schemes(for votes mainly) that can just affect the whole population but when it comes transformation of the entire public healthcare system, it's impossible as it needs a centralised ambitionist project & every state has their own autonomous healthcare ministry, more problematic when ruling parties are different. This applies to every units including infrastructure and industries& agriculture. Indeed there are 60 autonomous subjects on the state lists where one cannot interfere and is neither accountable to any higher authority. This contradictory federalism meant a disunity and lack of uniformity in various aspects such as say regional imbalances. It was for local specialisations but failed to achieve it and resulted in regionalism. The situation is entirely different for China which a Unitarian centralized Republic with subordinates at the provincial and local level so their people at the local level is in order with the highest level organisational goals. Also this problem of ours is accompanied by a hotchpotch multiparty democracy where leaders do popular things unlike China where they do right things because no fear of losing elections. This is accompanied by dysfunctional politics & corrupted, inefficient administrative,executive,legislative, judiciary structure & systems.  So I hope our national thinkers will come up with a solution to this that either concentrates on the units such as of HDI, Economic matters, public facilities,infrastructure etc at the provincial level to be subordinate under a centralised one, further their subdivisions into districts and local levels or vice versa- to begin from the lowest to go to the highest in an interconnected instead of autonomous i.e concentration of various of such units & administrative offices at the local level, unifying them at the district, unifying them further at the provincial level and last to he central level where at each higher level they are accountable to each other. This might address both local issues & collectivise them into 1 national issue.",1,1

32,2023-11-08T10:23:17Z,@GarudAtma,"'India's poor education system and job training' is not the right line.  'India's worthless education system and job training' is the right line.   Another example, there are n number of jobs for high-quality researchers but expensive universities are producing (1000)n number of high-quality students with PhDs.  I am not counting (1000000)n of poor quality students, grad, PhD holders.    One more, the Poor are the vote bank, govt takes taxes and gives free rations to the poor who can breed more poor ...  No population control with dirt poor. Means more free rations, which means more tax needed to be taken who earn a little bit better. Entrepreneurs and the employed middle class are fined for earning money with heavy personal income taxes (40-50% of their income) with no gains, security, healthcare, or schooling as all policies are made to cater huge poor population. Then there are house taxes, road taxes, etc. Poor don't give any direct taxes.   From 2005, an educated was earning 10k, in 2023 the base salary for an educated is the same. Whereas uneducated but skilled labor is earning 3 to 6 times more.   Property prices in the cities (only cities have jobs) are insane. School education is so expensive, useless, and theoretical and gives nothing in return.   This means that Indian sensible youths are stopping from having children.  Famous word -> unemployment. There are 10 lakh (1 million) youth entering the job market. No way any govt can create employment for them.  Youth are doomed. Kids of poor, lower-middle class(50k/month salary), and middle class (80k per month salary) are doomed already.   Rich can't be pressured to pay more taxes, otherwise, they will leave the country.  There are simple solutions but vote bank poor and middle class will vote the govt out of power. So a minister depends on his community and focuses on his community only. This brings a divide in politics. In other words Indian public is dum",0,0

Many politicians  just take the advantage of diversity and vilify one community and make them enemy of their core supporters. They do good work on paper and promote enmity between communities for votes.  Even after 75 years of independence, the people of backward communities are facing inhuman discrimination. They are denied opportunities which are normal to people in Europe. They can't do successful business, can't become influencers and when government give them opportunities then the privileged communities (out of jealousy) protest against it. [Casteism]   There was movement in Maharashtra where anti-bihari and anti-Tamil forced led them exit Mumbai because of Bal Thakry. [Regionalism]  After the BJP party came to power, many Hindus are becoming radicals criminals who are identifying and killing poor Muslims (sometimes rich). Many Muslims have been victims of mob lynching where the criminals are not just roaming free but are also rewarded.  Definitely, when educated people criticise these activities, they are termed as Urban Naxals, Anti-National, Pakistani, Chinese etc. So nobody dares to question government when they sell tribal lands and make them landless, or wasting money on Statue of Unity and Central Vista.

100,2023-10-14T23:53:02Z,@Elonfuckingmusk,I agree that education needs to be reformed and government should invest more in education and training.   But I also think India shouldnt be compared to China. China doesnt have the same freedoms as India. China has the advantage of taking on large scale projects that can last many years or even decades but India cannot do that to due government changing every election cycle.   7-8% of Chinese population pays income tax yet less than 2% of India pays income tax despite having similar number of people. The government can only do so much with such few resources although govt is working on that issue also with implementation of other forms of taxation.   About 35% of Chinese population depends on agriculture for livelihood but a shocking 58% of Indian population depends on agriculture for livelihood which includes women also. Its not that women do not participate in the economy but they standard for measuring their participation is limited. India has largest crop land of any country.    Chinas economy grew very fast and rapidly mostly due to manufacturing boom that lasted for past 3 decades but it doesnt seem very sustainable looking at their population demographics. Chinas growth isnt sustainable and theyre already in trouble with economy currently facing a major recession and youth unemployment sitting at 50%. They cant even release all of the data because its so disappointing. Meanwhile India is about to experience a tech boom and is placing itself strategically in the geopolitical shift currently taking place.

I know you want it to be over 10mins long for the ads etc, but the video would be of a much higher quality if you cut out the fluff. Id have felt much more engaged throughout if your script was tighter. So reduce the amount of extra points you add on to subjects with and thens and alsos. Most of those dont add much more to the original point and can make you lose focus as it can feel like repetition. You should also cut down some sections as it feels like a bot wrote some of it with how it goes on. For example you have a point at 8.37 which you finished at 8.49, but you then just continue on until 9.15. Thats around 25 seconds that should likely all be cut as it adds very little extra in meaningful info and can just make the viewer tune out.

Most importantly, comparing China and India might be useful in some aspects, but China is a majorly export oriented economy, so its high GDP/GDP per capita isnt necessarily an indicator for the higher standards of living that come with big economies. Also, increasing labour participation rates through putting more people in factories is the least socioeconomically sound idea in my opinion, and should certainly not be a metric for the success of economies.

From what I noticed living in India and living in the US for a bit is that India has (for whatever reason) very very poor social mobility. This isn't because we don't have laws its just that most people disregard them and follow what's been done for centuries etc etc. For example caste is still a big issue and I have heard of managers not hiring people because of their caste which really worsens the unemployment issues here.   A more concrete example with facts to back it would be the dowry system, while dowry is illegal in India its still done through extremely cheeky means (Buying gold for the son in law's parents or an apartment for them, etc true story I have heard 2- 3 cases where this happened ). Now imagine if the bride's father didn't have to save up 380k to 480k (it does get this expensive and yes I say father cause the mother would probably not work) rupees to get her married to someone.  He would be more willing to pump money into the economy instead of being hesitant to spend it for the obvious future expense of well 'selling' his daughter on the marriage market (I hate the concept of dowry as you can see).

India's comparison with China is unfair to say at least (especially when comparing GDP/ per capita metrics). China's numbers are notoriously unreliable. Would have really appreciated if you had included other emerging countries in chart. Which you didn't do.  2. Low youth unemployment in India is not as big a issue as it is in other countries because Indians typically join workforce in service level graduate jobs. In other countries, culture is like that students work waitressing / simple jobs while studying which makes their youth unemployment rate looks good. In India, student studying in university (even in IITs) will be counted as unemployed but all can agree that these students can add more value overall by studying not working simple waitressing jobs. Real metric that you should compare is yu employment above age if 25 (because by 25 Indians mostly are graduated and joined workforce. I don't think this number will be low.)

I doubt if any real r&d for the country is happening except at the premier institutes like Iisc. We need one leader like Nehru who has a vision to nurture Indian talents with the futuristic vision.  Any government wants only to cajole people by giving some fringe benefits to the citizens that will help them to win the next elections. Investments in r &d is going to give fruit atleast only after a decade. Though the beauraceats know all these facts everybody wants to carry their daily targets only . This country needs a visionary leader to take us forward in leaps and bounds  instead of a populous  leader who Carries out activities required as marketing strategies for next elections  The government can constitute a high empowered committee to study the various talents that are produced here and the place where they get fitted in the international markets.  Initially medium level such ecosystems can be visualized and built.  Infact such ecosystems can be built within the present national higher education institutes and targets can be fixed so that revenue that will be generated from these research institutes will itself take care of the present higher education spending by the government. The government can encourage the private players to take this to the market on ppp basis .  If this problem is not addressed right now,  In the kind of migration that is happening in the last decade, the already populous country will be only a junk of low iq  people.",0,0

I feel that you have very well explored the statistics excellently, but I do feel you need to focus on the backstory of the statistics or rather why has India taken such a path, compared to other Asian Countries.  India focused on closed door development till completely opening up at 1990s so obviously the investment has just started to flow in compared to other nations which had more abrupt reforms. Their lead is due to the facts that their markets were more open to foreign investment compared to others.  I also feel you are also underestimating the Total GDP's potential. Of course having a good percapita GDP is good, but again 1.4 billion id not a small number so I do feel you need to see that even a  section of that population as customers is huger than many countries. Sure they may not be high value customers, but there are demands from every customer whether high value or low value  Also you have not explored the differences inside India, for example the southern states are more industrialised and can be comparable to South East Asia.  I do need to question one thing though, can you really compare China or Japan with India? For sure they are closer to each other than say European nations or the US, but really they have taken their own due to different scenarios and I do feel are not good for comparison.  I do also feel you a very tinted lens in this video, but might just be me.",0,1

I gained wide experience in ports and land/rail transport infrastructures in those countries due to my transportation related job. Then I had a similar experience in China for 14 years.  Briefly, I have enough experience to comment on two countries. Indian businessmen and politicians are babbling about unrealistic goals and groundless scenarios in their endless talks. Chinese are without talking about setting up targets, making plans, focusing on the work, and finishing the work as soon as possible. How can India make their dreams come true when all their ports container handling volumes cannot be equal to a single port in China? How can they persuade foreign investors to invest when it is obvious what they had done to Xiaomi?   The productivity of Indian workers is horrible. I saw sleeping workers in between the noisy textile machines in a very large textile factory in Ahmedabad, and that was not the only one in my memory. You cannot even think about it in China. Unfortunately, business ethics are almost nonexistent in India. They only look at their own interests and do any dirty tricks to eliminate any intermediate parties, while Chinese look at the same parties as business partners and keep everybody's interests within the business they do. They are well aware that a win-win scenario is the touchstone of long-term business relations.   The video is not talking about the blackouts in India or corruption. There are only two holidays in China, one in the spring and the other in the autumn. Whereas there are many religious holidays in India for every ethnic worker and famous tea breaks in the factories and offices that obstruct the work on a regular basis, So, talking in video and promising a bright future is nice, but it is far from reality.",9,0

India banking sector is very strong and done very good job in implementing banking regulations. These banking cleanup happens after a major banking crisis hit in 2016.  3.

Villages discriminate against other villages, religion discriminates against other religions, different communities discriminate against other communities.  If you are a true citizen of india, then you know very well how it is in your home and the conversations you have about your people.  India can only grow if it is truly united, when indians have discarded the concepts of Brahmins, dalits, Hindus, Muslims, biharis, UP.  When someone from other state looks down on people from other state then how can india grow. People accept English instead of Hindi. Hindi is enforced but actually most of the states in India are non-Hindi speaking states.  Indians are proud of their culture. But denies the truth that for centuries indians have discriminated and stolen, cheated, blackmailed each other based on caste, creed and color. That's Indian history.  Indians don't respect fellow indians. Try to observe how when you shop. Observe while you are in traffic. Observe as you stand in line for a simple movie ticket. Do you find this experience peaceful. No, no. You are in anxiety. You are on high alert as most of the indians will cut in line to take your place. Is there respect shown to you as a human being?  That's the indian mentality.

They dare not to think whether there is a deeper issue within their current system, and they dare not to think adjusting the system to really adopt local needs and mentality.   They believe in democracy like they believe in regions, especially Hinduism. They believe that with democracy, India would develop slower but firmly, and eventually have a better future, but no one knows when exactly.  Maybe they are expecting next life.

Instead of watching fake negative news about China and feeling good about the competition.  Ever since Xi being in the office, there has been several waves of anti-corruption movement, and many officials got arrested and sentenced.

In India 45% population is involved in agriculture and allied sectors yet all those who are involved in these sectors are exempted from paying income tax. Only 3 to 5% of Indian population pays income taxes most of whom are from so called upper castes (250 million people out of 1400 million Indian population). To make things worse in higher education and administrative jobs approximately 60% seats are reserved for so called lower castes and rest 40% are made available to them with a preference to so called lower castes via low cut off in entrance exams leading to mediocrity getting in prime institutes and administration in the name of reparations. In simple words in India 20% population (the so called upper castes) pay almost all of income taxes while rest leech on it. India's stunted growth and poverty is man made via apartheid style social justice politics.",1,1

When china reached the ceiling set by US then it also became an enemy 4. the problem with Bharat's economy is that it is somewhat organic unlike other economies, combined with socialist principle its growth rate was sluggish for most of the time",0,0

538,2023-05-19T23:05:03Z,@HEEHEEBOII,"The actual key issue which I believe is the root cause of all this is because Indians are not use to running a unified subcontinent, as prior to the British colonization of Indian subcontinent, the area is made up of many different Rajs or Maharajs or sultanates. After modern India got its independence from the British, they ruled India using the same colonial model as their ex colonial masters. The issues with India, or India faces are the same issue in many different ex colonial countries. Very unfair and bureaucratic government and government agencies, rampant corruption, sectarian violence, and inequality amongst different tribes, race or ethnicities. We see the same problem in many African nations as well which is why they are lagging behind and still lags behind. While India is a \""democracy\"", there is no real free election in India, there are vote coercion, bribery and targeted political attacks as well. majority of Indians that immigrate abroad never wishes to go back (same with Africans), this is a drastically different than China, Korea, Japan or even Vietnam. Unfortunately future is bleak, although India is in BRICS and SCO, it has not been keeping good relations with its neighbors or partners within the SCO or BRICS, with the constant propaganda in the country about how India is much stronger than \""X\"" country fooling the average Indians, the government appears to have given up on actually enlightening its citizens and facing reality.",0,0

The reason Bangladesh beats India on garments exports is related directly to Indian Labour Laws which protect the lazy and incompetent workers and incentivise industry to go for activities which reduce labour force. Different governments have talked of overhauling the laws but very little of the needed reform has been done. This is a far bigger factor than education. India's expenditure on education is about 20% of total government expenditure and it is difficult to increase this further.,1,0

(2)Secondly India has already passed china in population (This video is old). (3)Thirdly While they say in ratio but It had to checked in population because Bangladesh,Pakistan and all the countries mentioned has lower population than India  so Male to female could be managed and also many of them were under strict risk charts under Female excate while China is a outright imperial Capatalist  country even more than US and also they had 2 decades of extra time while india did not. (4)I agree Unemployment is 5-7 % because population is growing and also Covid hit India badly as it's impact on country like India which is big and populous could have serious outcomes and we saw that to China. (5)Indian unemployment is really different it exists only in middle class that to also in lower and average and also with a portion of poor class. (6)While 0.8% extreme poverty left in country according to IMF and poverty is now 10%. (7) And also while Bangladesh Srilanka Pakistan and even some European economies like spain and even Ireland and also to many people's suprise Slavic and Nothern European Countries have Taken IMF bail out packages. (8)Yes modi could not double but He made sure That India faced less impact of covid and India's economy grows even out with recession in th world.  (9)Yes Exports could be grown up but Indian domestic market has already grown to a large for Indian domestic sellers. (10) Yes india has allocated very less to education and budget for research like isro is very low which I myself criticize but second thought government has increased vocational training in skill India and also in CBSE/ICSE/NIOS/even state boards and universities too. (11) But recently investment summit  in state of UP  and foreign sharks meet in Maharastra India got more than  net 500 billions dollars of investment as FDI. (12) India is growing but 7-8% is less I belive it should be atleast 12-16% as  in first 3 quaters of 3 years atleast  You can't deny this facts mow. (13) You forgot many of india's state as such as 13 are high HDI and 14 in medium and soon gonna join high hdi and also India is cheaper than Europe and Africa if per capita is concerned and as for PPP terms it is 3rd so More people can afford better lifestyle with low as 5000$ a years.",1,0

It takes time and resources to make meaningful changes in these areas, and the government has to balance competing priorities and interests.  Moreover, the issue of pay gap and employment is not just about the government's policies but also involves market forces, societal attitudes, and individual choices. Some jobs and industries are simply more profitable and in demand than others, and it's not always possible or desirable to equalize pay and opportunities across the board.  Similarly, education and employment success depend on many factors beyond the teachers' dedication and the government's funding, such as students' background, motivation, and access to resources. It's not fair to blame teachers or the government for all the problems in education and employment, nor to assume that throwing more money or regulations at them would automatically solve them.",1,4

Everything is about mugging up books & writing it in written examinations. No wonder all the brilliant students just leave the country for higher education & never come back.   Indian Government needs to spend atleast 10-15% of GDP on research & education. They need to restructure the education system from scratch which is more focused on real life & less bookish knowledge checking a student's application of mind rather than memory.,2,2

905,2023-03-09T23:55:25Z,@MrAtaguas,One of the big issues that India has had since the industrial revolution is India's reliance on non-industrial labor. All of these people need to be brought up to 21 century standards in terms of education and capability to be able to assimilate into the 21st-century economy. The 50% of the population below 25yo sounds good on paper until you realize they can only do very low-level manual labor. In the age of automation that labor is of little to no use which creates rampant poverty and chaos. All those people need to be brought up through trade school or University to be able to do jobs in industries that are valued in the global marketplace. Now this issue is also rooted in or linked to the fact that unlike neighboring China India is infinitely diverse which again sounds good on paper but try unifying a country with many castes creeds and religions in it. The cleanest solution to all this in my opinion is that India should be broken along state lines in individual countries or each state be given full autonomy so that each state almost becomes a micronation like Singapore. Divide and conquer is the way to go especially because enforcing laws/rules/order can be done only if that happens. At the very least you could truncate states like Bihar and UP that no offense are dragging the country down statistically speaking.,1,0

I am an aspirant of NET, the eligibility test for students to become professors in colleges and universities. So I have good knowledge regarding India's expenditure on health and education. India spent around 2.9% on education in 2021, it was declined due to Covid, but has increased by around 1200 crores in 2022, making it the highest expenditure ever.  In healthcare the expenditure is around 3.2%. Now, I'd request you to kindly check India's Purchasing Power Parity with that of USD. Because of Indian medicines being created in India itself, we get medicines at very cheap prices. In fact its is free for economically weaker sections. In fact education is also free of cost in India and students get free mid day meals at schools.",0,0

There is disproportionately high number of these temporary positions, in which people work for years renewing contracts every year, with barely any labour rights and pennies for payment. Those people are overworking and covers the work load of 2 or 3 regular employees. Resulting is subpar productivity and less income distribution. On top of that the government extending retirement age to save money.  It's extremely paradoxical for a country to have both very high growth and unemployment. India's unemployment problem is just underemployment and worker exploitation in disguise and that's why there is no shortage of both tech as well as blue collar workers working all over the world. So the education infrasture isn't really inadequate, those who graduate are just not getting hired because they are keeping 1 person for 3 people's work and the unjust hours have no consequences",0,0

Take this for an example, if foreigners, let's consider just the USA for now, had successfully acquired over 90% share in the Indian market then, Indian economy will also go down if the US based companies go down because of recession due to war or whatever.

1300,2023-02-26T20:47:24Z,@basiclegend3813,"Many points are debatable here but anyways i can agree on the fact that India does have almost nothing in job opportunities. Hense it makes the education system trash as well. India do promotes higher level education greatly and it can be considered successful but in contrast it fails completely when it comes to job providing. There are very few job opportunities in India and those who manage to get a job it makes 70%+ graduates over qualified. Even though majority of these graduates are not considered best by world standards, they are at the least decent.  And even bigger problem with job is majority of current working youth are not certain about security of their job as well. Most young graduates work at best 3 years then there's a break of at least a year for them . Biggest reason being getting stuck in a job without seeing any growth or progress for the future. So they just choose to be idle. So this creates a job opportunities for many and the vacant places are filled in no time, almost instantly because of high unemployment. And the cycle continues. Most of these job opportunities are result of the bad management as no one moniters them. Only few works while rest dont, even when everyone wants to. And those who work are underpaid most of the times. Thats why India has very low per capita. India pumps engineering graduates yearly like they are Chinese cabbages. Of which most are decent yet with lack of opportunities you will find them working in a field completely foreign to their educational background like government jobs, banking and marketing. 40%+ Indians are farmers. But almost all of them only farm to make ends meet. Majority of farmers can produce lot more than what they are currently producing but they are aware of the fact that it will never get sold at right price. Prices are so low that it doesn't matter if they produce more or just enough. The word profit is never known by any farmers till today.  You will see a certain state farmers will let the over produced good rot rather than selling, while other states which would have sky high demand for that rotten good. And this happen to every state in India. This is again all due to the fact that there's no one to monitor it and oversee it.  Farming and service sectors makes   70%+ current Indian economy and this is not happening by some government led plans and management its just because people trying their best to make the ends meet. This has created its own economical sphere. $100-150/month is average income for majority of Indians. And the term world uses for low labour cost for indians when they come here or higher them in foreign countries is in fact very high, atleast double than average.  The Indian economic scenario is very interesting. On one side of the coin you can say its very bad because of the low income of average citizens yet on the other side, you can only baffle at the fact that all of this is self made by people just to make the ends meet yet its working, although crude but it is most certainly working.

Lemme explain first. Majority of the population thinks emotionally rather than practically.

And if people do not like a  politician they say our country  is doing bad this that. EU,ASIAN,US even china do not have that kind of problem. I'm sure what you said maybe true but we also can't deny all these problems. When government set out to do something NGO's protest and if government crack down on those NGO's west print this government killing people etc etc, every day people do protest so consensus on anything in india  is very hard. China have very simple policy they do every project according to future if anyone objects no problem they have solutions and no western media will report that national media  also do not report that so people do not know what happened so no protests from citizens, NGO's, no dictation from courts. SO Democracy in big population is hard on that if you have  country so diverse like india where after 5 KM language changes, people behaviour change, people's thinking change, people's views change, their views about government change  so it is very hard and on that every little matter western media report like this is something new that happened and indian government is out to destroy everything, on the other hand when  something happens in for example in US that train accident did we saw anything government shut down media arrested report who was reported on that, no backlash to government  you see all these things matter how national media and western media present countries that matters. SO many mass shooting in US are people afraid??? NO do any country made  US unsafe in their media no but if that happens in india west will show it like all hell broke loose and india is the worse country to live. SO brother it is easy to say do this that, what very hard to  do. I think if we want growth like china we have to have Western support where they do not present india as demon and every little protests which are common in democracy show as  people are tired of government if that not happen the we need system like china leave democracy that also depends on West if they approve that or not.

I've seen even the people from lower economic classes are sending their kids to private schools instead of government schools. Due to lack of students many schools, especially vernacular medium schools were forced to shut down, and there is less spending in education year after year. But these parents belonging to lower economic class, many times aren't well educated and work long hours, so they can't understand quality of education or aid there children with studies, further they're really ignorant about importance of education, I've seen many parents leave for their native places for months not bothering about their children missing out on schooling. This has lead to poor quality of education, because education doesn't stop at school, parents have to be involved with studies and give due importance to it.  There's also the point that system itself is redundant. Teaching patterns and methods are based on rote learning and memorization rather than application based studies, analytical thinking and in-depth understanding of concepts.

Economic liberalization started only in 1992 in India , in China it started in 1970's so obviously there is a 20 year head start.  India's capital and forex reserves have quadrupled , the debt to gdp ratio for India is very very very healthy. ( Public debt is very low compared to many other countries)   Your point on female workfroce is ALSO WRONG.  India has more skilled female workforce on a percentage level than South Asia. ( aka more women work in IT and software rather than tailoring and manufacturing ( as in BD )   Indian stock market by market cap is now close to being the 3rd largest in the world. Indian FDI is at the highest point right now ( you forgot the debacle of covid and 2020 ) which caused a dip in the economy.

1395,2023-02-20T14:11:15Z,@krishnanunnimadathil8142,"Watched your video with interest. A small critique. The pieces do not add up in your presentation. You have compared Indias female labour force participation rate with Bangladesh and Vietnams, without explaining the reason for the lopsidedness.   Bangladesh and Viet Nam both enjoy Free Trade Agreements with the EU and US, something which India cannot easily get by virtue of its large economic size. Leave aside the exception that is garments, and the labour force participation rate of women in Bangladesh should match or be worse than Indias.   You also proceeded next to cite Indias poor education standards as part of the reason for the low female labour force participation rate. The female workers in Bangladesh or Viet Nam, which you cited, are not given to education either; and at any rate, the quality of education in these places is poorer at the tertiary level. Do garment factory workers need any real literacy or education to operate? I dont think so.   That said, literacy and skilling of women in India is generally poor and has a long way to go.   FDI: In a world where the appetite for investing in foreign markets is declining, to ask for a country to increase the percentage of FDI in the economy is counterintuitive. That said, India has registered consistent growth in terms of FDI, recently touching USD 100 billion. Much lower than China yes, but still.   Exports: I would question the validity of the export-led growth hypothesis given that the largest market for Indian goods and services is inside India itself - a free trade area of 1.4 billion people. That India will have a current account deficit is a natural outcome given these factors. There will always be more people within India demanding Indian goods and services than outside of her.",26,3
