VIDEO INTRODUCTION: India is one of the biggest traders in the world economy!!! But do you know what is the most valuable resource we export??? most people might look at the stat and say it's engineering goods and petroleum products!!
but In reality, the most valuable resources we export are the goddamn people of India!!!! and you must have seen this every August when our friends proudly leave India and take out a 30-60 lakhs loan just to go and study in the US!!! and while most people think its, not a big deal at all,
I gotta tell you, that when Talented people like you leave India, it costs the Indian economy an insane 17 billion dollars or 1.36 Lakh crores every single year!!! You know much money that is, it's more than 2 times the profit of Reliance Industries, 19 times the profit of Bajaj Finance, and 28 times of the profit of Adani ports!!!
This my dear friends is bleeding the Indian economy every single year!! and as citizens of the country, this is one of the burning issues that we need to focus if at all we want to become a 10 trillion economy!!
So in this special case study, let's try to understand,
What is so terribly wrong about the design of Indian education that India has become a dalal of talent for the world?
What are the fundamental reasons for the talent drain of India?
and most importantly, as citizens of the country where do we need to push the govt to fix this brain drain problem of India???
