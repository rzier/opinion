Some people counter argue that even the people of India are uneducated and will misuse. But then should we never expect a better standard of living? its like one person had a car accident and cars all across city is banned. In short people here are not happy everyone looks irritated, struggling whereas out of India everyone are happy, smiling, greeting.

Though I love India, the socio-economic conditions in India don't allow me to thrive in India. It's such a misery. I hope it will change in the future.", "authorDisplayName": "@nelsondcruz2096", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIf8zZSLWmBt4ZwTQ_Hgy14nunNyMC8L8WSnYRh7SN9SSaw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQev-L_mbzEw0WCFsNRPAA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvQev-L_mbzEw0WCFsNRPAA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2023-08-28T17:56:30Z", "updatedAt": "2023-08-28T17:56:30Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "K60B3GUCwohZ2VxojWc5QeK_DHU", "id": "UgwVGDEG4hX8KPoAY3x4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "KVkAbyTjgMRQfaj2olrJyJjD11A", "id": "UgwVGDEG4hX8KPoAY3x4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "textDisplay": "Poor indians labor also migrating out legally & illegally.

School. The remarkable work you are all engaged in is truly commendable, and I am genuinely impressed by your dedication and accomplishments. Please accept my best wishes as you continue down this path of excellence.\r\n\r\nAllow me to introduce myself as a cardiac surgeon with a profound commitment to advancing Translational research in the field of Ayurveda. Over the course of more than three decades, I have invested a substantial portion of my life into this pursuit. Despite the passage of time, my passion for this work remains undiminished, and I am resolute in my commitment to its continuation. In fact, my strong affinity for my work prompted me to make the deliberate decision to leave the allure of more favorable opportunities in the Western world and return to India in December 2017 after my 17 years of stint in the western (Canada, USA) world. The research I conducted garnered significant acclaim within the British Parliament, leading to invitations extended to me on two distinct occasions to address the esteemed members within the House of Commons. Moreover, the fact that I was invited to speak not just once but twice at the House of Commons underscores the significance of my findings and insights. \n\r\nAll this was possible because, I stand as the sole individual in the whole wolrd, who successfully modeled the Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas in experimental animals, a feat that has generated a substantial volume of data. This accomplishment also encompassed the development of distinctive markers for each dosha, underscoring the pioneering nature of my work. Furthermore, I have achieved a distinct milestone by showcasing the regeneration potential of vital organs such as the heart, a phenomenon that I am the sole demonstrator of within the field.\r\n\r\nBeyond these achievements, my commitment to innovation is evident through the filing of more than 17 patents and about an impressive count of 41 technologies that are deemed patentable. My  track record as an Intergative Physician speaks volumes as we have effectively provided treatment to a substantial count of over 28,000 patients in the advanced stages of their illnesses, achieving favorable outcomes in each case. The success achieved in these treatments is a testament to our expertise and dedication in managing end-stage patients with a high degree of proficiency, By properly aligning our accumulated expertise with the right resources and strategies, India can establish itself as a global leader in addressing end-stage diseases. This entails collaborative efforts among various stakeholders, including healthcare institutions, researchers, policymakers, and industry partners. The journey towards capturing a significant share of the 1.2 trillion-dollar market demands foresight, investment, and a commitment to delivering world-class healthcare solutions.\r\n\r\nHowever, upon my return, I encountered a significant challenge: the Ministry of AYUSH lacks the necessary expertise among its members, resulting in a fundamental misunderstanding of the core principles of research and a dearth of scientific temperament. Regrettably, the competitive environment for mediocrity that characterized the landscape 25 years ago still persists. This culture undermines the appreciation of valuable contributions made by individuals, while simultaneously inflating the self-importance of their own people inside the ministry and govt institutions. Despite my efforts to share the insights garnered from my research data, there appears to be a resistance to implementing this knowledge.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have observed a distressing lack of scientific temperament even within the community of Ayurvedic doctors. The reluctance to embrace learning and the prevailing attitude of possessing all-encompassing knowledge hinder the growth and evolution of this field. Engaging in meaningful conversations with these professionals proves challenging due to their deeply ingrained preconceptions.\nThe reputation of Prime Minister Modi as a leader with an unwavering commitment to honesty and transparency is a sentiment that resonates strongly among the populace. His personal conduct and statements consistently reflect a dedication to upholding ethical standards and combating corruption. This perception has solidified his position as a figure of integrity in the eyes of many. Nonetheless, the larger administrative framework in which Prime Minister Modi's efforts are channeled is grappling with a persistent challenge: the infiltration of corrupt elements. These individuals, driven by self-interest and a disregard for ethical considerations, undermine the noble goals set by the Prime Minister. Their actions stand in stark contrast to his principles and cast a shadow over the broader system's effectiveness.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully realize the transformative vision that Prime Minister Modi envisions for the nation, addressing the issue of corruption within the system is of paramount importance. This calls for comprehensive reforms that not only target punitive measures against corrupt individuals but also focus on preventative measures, such as strengthening accountability mechanisms and fostering a culture of transparency.\r\n\r\nBeyond these concerns, another disheartening issue arises: a blatant disregard for the rules outlined in the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Even the most basic traffic regulations are flouted, leading to immense stress for individuals navigating the streets. This casual approach to rules and norms creates an environment of chaos and poses risks to the safety and well-being of all road users.\n\nRemaining resolute in my decision, I want to emphasize that my departure from India is not on the horizon. As long as my commitment to transforming my enterprise into a thriving unicorn company remains unfulfilled, I am firmly rooted here. However, my intention is to extend valuable insights to those individuals who might be contemplating a return to India, equipping them with a comprehensive understanding of the prevailing circumstances.\r\n\r\nMy determination to stay within the Indian landscape is driven by a fervent ambition to elevate my enterprise to the esteemed status of a unicorn. This entails a relentless pursuit of innovation, growth, and excellence, as I strive to contribute to the nation's entrepreneurial ecosystem. My vision aligns closely with India's burgeoning potential, and I am resolute in my belief that my efforts can contribute positively to its economic and technological advancement.\r\n\r\nIn my endeavor to share insights with potential returnees, my aim is to provide a nuanced perspective on the current state of affairs. I recognize the significance of well-informed decisions, especially in a dynamic and ever-evolving environment like India. By offering accurate and comprehensive information, I intend to empower those considering a return with the knowledge necessary to navigate challenges and seize opportunities effectively.\r\n\r\nWhile my personal journey is intrinsically tied to India's entrepreneurial landscape, I acknowledge the broader context within which decisions are made. Factors ranging from economic trends and regulatory frameworks to technological advancements and socio-political dynamics play a pivotal role in shaping the environment for both startups and established businesses. Thus, sharing insights goes beyond mere advice; it's an act of fostering awareness and preparedness for those intending to contribute to India's growth story.\r\n\r\nIn essence, my journey in the realm of Ayurvedic Translational research has been both inspiring and challenging. While I remain steadfast in my dedication, the landscape is marred by a lack of understanding, a culture of mediocrity, and a reluctance to adapt.

Jio (Ambani - Reliance) launched a Laptop and within days India announced restrictions on imports even though the Jio Laptop is full of Chinese components... this is only the most recent one. Remember how the govt kneecapped BSNL to favour Jio? Inflation is rampant. Household debts have increased by 37%. India is ok for the very rich or the very poor... and there is no hope for the actual tax paying middle class. Given the falling birth rates in Europe and far east... the Indian middle class exodus will only increase. Lets not even get into the indirect taxes.

You need to understand this serious situation. Students who do not get campus placement and are equally capable with skills just like who got placed are applying for jobs and hardly getting any chance. This is because these institutes train people and give resources to the company and companies first preference goes to such institutes and not the individual who is applying.

Because children in India rely on their parents' money even after finishing school, they feel the obligation to select the field which their parents either directly prefer or which the child thinks they'd prefer. In other cases parents either directly decide their children's career path or indirectly by comparing them only to those students who got successful in engineering or medicine and not any arts or commerce related fields.\n\nI think this presence of a pool of mostly unwilling and passion-less engineers who made compromise and settled with whatever was available to them is the reason why a lot of them are unemployable.\n\nThe day we start giving equal importance to other fields is the day everything starts changing.", "authorDisplayName": "@tractortyre4260", "authorProfileImageUrl":

The startups visited the campus, looked up for Algorithms and Data Structure Nerds. Unfortunately I wasn't one and hence didn't get any initial drives. The placement cell had compelled me to sit for BPO hiring. They just want everyone to secure some placements to keep a 100% placement tag.

Patriotism fades away and what is practical takes precedence. \n\nWhen a talented hardworking Indian citizen pay taxes and don\u2019t see those tax rupees translate into better infrastructure, more investment in R&D, social security for the old, ease of doing business, level playing field for small and large businesses, capital for startups, they are forced to leave the county and go to a place where they know their tax dollars will be put to good use.", "authorDisplayName": "@devrajkhatri8085", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIf8zZRxapZcwN0fYNIc2iyUi2YsUHgtla9oawDUHw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj9HQ-NAr8UzyaN0JwA915Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCj9HQ-NAr8UzyaN0JwA915Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-08-20T16:52:12Z", "updatedAt": "2023-08-20T16:52:12Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "ZaxdRRWOzK0QH3LXqkah_67BcgQ", "id": "UgxiHSnp2Y8oHh6JGBB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "XSb04lNiO162Xao_JSvAesoGsBg", "id": "UgxiHSnp2Y8oHh6JGBB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "textDisplay": "there is a website by the name swayam.gov.in .....its an official govt site where one can find study materials,videos and other stuff that too from iit and iim professors", "textOriginal": "there is a website by the name swayam.gov.in .....its an official govt site where one can find study materials,videos and other stuff that too from iit and iim professors", "authorDisplayName": "@vanshkhushalani", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIf8zZSPvnK503__UHjizestCUlSA_mJxox3HS2Gyw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTaUsW4FYbxR8iwQY7LPqzA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTaUsW4FYbxR8iwQY7LPqzA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-08-20T16:51:56Z", "updatedAt": "2023-08-20T16:51:56Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "wBXFYkMFu_t2_XAylZPYRIQdsng", "id": "UgwvPo_JYGUvBt7wuEN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "dyuzgka0aqCkS1LHxHYslGWc3SQ", "id": "UgwvPo_JYGUvBt7wuEN4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "textDisplay": "First of all the students have to understand that what our government is trying to convey for our future.

average 4-6 hours in school and 3-6 hours in coaching everyday and then studies on his own for at least one to two hours , Sachin tendulkar became criketer at 16 and he started playing at 11 if we compare his training hours for 5 years he must have given 21900 hours (ideal year of being able to play cricket everyday for 12 hours), if we compare the hours of a person who wasted his life studying and ended up jobless is just disheartening, I think people should migrate instead of committing suicides in collages and coaching \nEven in delhi the freebies giving goverment is useless just look at how many coachings are there in Delhi.\n\nAnd the worst part is the people who think iq is constant and think they won't be able to increase a student iq if they don't understand what they are saying and use it as an excuse and focus on some handfull children , Alfred Binet created iq test to see how many student needed attention and he said \"Education can improve IQ\" (i mean they could have learned some better method of teaching students from western countries but they only learn excuses)\n\nIt's better to become an US or UK citizen as this problem of education will stay in India and

cannot argue that the goverment allways disappoints when it comes to giving them education) I think it's better to become a US citizen and settle there , just think about it as a student you somehow survive the rote learning system and then in coachings you waste time relearning things degrading your health , Indians spent average 4-6 hours in school and 3-6 hours in coaching everyday and then studies on his own for at least one to two hours , Sachin tendulkar became criketer at 16 and he started playing at 11 if we compare his training hours for 5 years he must have given 21900 hours (ideal year of being able to play cricket everyday for 12 hours), if we compare the hours of a person who wasted his life studying and ended up jobless is just disheartening, I think people should migrate instead of committing suicides in collages and coaching \nEven in delhi the freebies giving goverment is useless just look at how many coachings are there in Delhi.\n\nAnd the worst part is the people who think iq is constant and think they won't be able to increase a student iq if they don't understand what they are saying and use it as an excuse and focus on some handfull children , Alfred Binet created iq test to see how many student needed attention and he said \"Education can improve IQ\" (i mean they could have learned some better method of teaching students from western countries but they only learn excuses)\n\nIt's better to become an US or UK citizen as this problem of education will stay in India and would not come to an end till three to four generation\nAll the hardwork in education just to go to a collage which asks you to write a program in 29.7 x 21 cm copy.", "authorDisplayName": "@awadheshsharanchaurasia7248", "authorProfileImageUrl":

Most of it goes to pay the salaries and perks of the service providers, who form the balance 15% of which about half goes to the armed forces. Payment to the Armed forces is well deserved but the other half often take a greater share, simply because they control the Govt machinery. The true producers of wealth don't get a fair share of the wealth that they produce and therefore emigrate to more proactive countries. This is a great liss yo India in real terms.\n\nInstead of building  showpiece buildings and infrastructure with low cost  development funds, it is the MSMEs that need the low cost funds with easy access. \n\n\n Author ChittaRanjan Bhatt,", "authorDisplayName": "@elsonicsanto", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIf8zZS4tEKhizBRBZY7uc3SfZwuRNKdicjLBqmFSfO3=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvwMSagEUf5-MVDPu_VXNcw", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvwMSagEUf5-MVDPu_VXNcw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-08-20T15:38:30Z", "updatedAt": "2023-08-20T15:38:30Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}, {"kind": "youtube#commentThread", "etag": "Fc4MaqQemBXW0wwzbfkYa7go4XY", "id": "Ugzo53uo49NWXAYOXfB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "topLevelComment": {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "NtKMcvEByqc_7DXjkmmRM7Uuz2A", "id": "Ugzo53uo49NWXAYOXfB4AaABAg", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKZozRVHRYsYHGEyNKuhhdA", "videoId": "KYFdxuLFVyQ", "textDisplay": "People are migrating out of India for multiple reason & not only for Better Job Opportunities.

But, even after 76 years of Independence, no political party dare to touch this, futher all political clout goes for increase the reservations.  Provide the additional facilities to compete with others for the reserved, economically backward rather giving the reservations. I dont understand that, even in Promotions in PS and Govts' they have this reservation cota.
