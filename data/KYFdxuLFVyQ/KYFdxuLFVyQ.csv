4,2023-11-26T08:36:11Z,@codelunatic,"Having worked extensively in the West and now running my own business in India, I've observed a stark contrast in attitudes towards entrepreneurs. In the West, there's a celebration of the entrepreneurial spirit and risk-taking. Conversely, in India, there's a prevalent mindset that views business owners as unscrupulous, and profit-making is often seen negatively. This perception creates numerous obstacles in running a business, with a labyrinth of licensing requirements and widespread bureaucratic inefficiencies. Instead of focusing on actual business operations, a significant amount of time is consumed in 'managing' these systemic issues.",0,0

People leaving India and finding work abroad is NOT a problem, its just an alternative solution. Lets look at some of the key benefits here -  1. $100bn remittance annually - We export people and reap dividends like no other country. This has been a tremendous help in lowering our current account deficit.  2. Lowering unemployment in our country - If I am an engineer working in a company and leave abroad, another person will replace me. Because I left, another family is able to feed themselves.  3. Growth in exports! - When we move to another country, we become consumers of Indian products/ services. Be it movies, cricket, Indian food brands etc.  So this situation needs to be evaluated from alternate angles too. Keep in mind, we take loans in India to study abroad and repay that loan in India from what we earn abroad, so every penny flows back. Jai Hind!",0,0

The extreme wealth inequality in the distribution of wealth is currently experienced. The distribution of wealth, particularly the GDP growth, does not reach the masses.  The top 5% of wealthy individuals in the country hold 60% of the nation's wealth, while a staggering 50% of the population has access to only 3% of the national wealth. Figures like Mukesh Ambani earning 23,000 rupees per second, which translates to 198.7 crore rupees per day, and Gautam Adani making 1002 crore rupees annually, while 68% of the population earns just 146 rupees a day, highlight the skewed wealth distribution.  These statistics paint a disturbing picture of income inequality in India. The richest individuals in the country accumulate vast fortunes, while a significant portion of the population struggles to meet their basic needs. This distorted growth exacerbates poverty and leads to health and nutritional inadequacies for around 70% of Indians.  Every year, approximately 17 lakh (1.7 million) deaths occur due to diseases related to food insufficiency and malnutrition. Meeting the basic needs of the majority, which includes access to nutritious food and healthcare, remains elusive. This extraordinary wealth gap has a profound impact on the overall well-being of the nation's citizens.  Currently, India has the largest population of the world's poorest, numbering 228.9 million. The stark economic inequality hinders the majority from accessing essential resources for a healthy and fulfilling life. This is a testament to the astounding impact of the skewed wealth distribution in the Indian economy. Without addressing this issue, India's progress will continue to be marred by the striking disparity between the rich and the poor, with dire consequences for the majority.",1,0

That country imo has got so much potential. Lots of educated people but there is far too much BS going on with their classist system and their government even though its viewed as being democratic isn't really. This idea about not allowing people to educate themselves has gotta be the stupidest idea. And i dont just mean in India its the same literally across the world. Luckily with the internet education is far more accessible now. I think they need to simply put the highest level of education on the internet then make it as low cost as possible. I think the people of India should be very proud of the Chandrayaan-3 and what they accomplished there. The government needs to do more to keep the people there,1,1

As someone who decided to stay in India despite several opportunities to move abroad, we have 2 major problems for those who stay here -   1. A weak passport means freedom of movement is curtailed. Applying for visas at every turn prevents us from leveraging industry conferences, business opportunities, etc all of which become almost instantly accessible with a North American or European passport. If we want world class industry leaders, we should make every effort for them to go participate in the world stage while still living here. This is a problem for those who stay and want to keep India as their home. My passport has seen it's fair share of travel but that comes at a cost - both monetary and in time.   2. Compliance is a never ending shit storm. As someone who wants to stay here, run a business and be compliant with all the processes, it is literally 50% of my workload if not more.

Having said that, whether it is a head of the state or a head of the family, one has to ensure that every penny is used to obtain complete value from any expense.

Specifically the insight on the government spending 50% higher education fund on 3% of students. Also , I myself am a student who pursued Master's in Sweden and am currently working as an algorithm Engineer in India . After observing the system , I totally agree that University -industry synergy in India needs to be at par with what foreign countries .   Coming to this I have an opinion on how non engineering degrees like MA in history , archeology etc also need reform . In my opinion India has such an ancient civilization with centuries of exposure to foreign culture right from Greek to Mughal to Turkish , Chinese , British etc that can be utilised for these students. National projects  for an integrated archelogical survey of Indian sights which are not usually explored and left in ruins . Universities can tie up with state and central archelogical departments with heirarical approach from central - state- University level for such exploration , which may also enhance and genrate tourism for tier 2 or tier 3 cities as with exploration would come preservation and restoration of these sites. I don't have much statistics but this is a hypothesis I have.   Since thinkschool has a great interactive way of linking such topics with economy , can such a video be made on potential economic loss and future aspect of student  using ruined and remained archelogical  sites.",0,0

About 2% pnly and out of these the reserved jobs comes. So you are arguing these small number of reserved category employees in india pulled down the growth and development? How illogical it is!. In last 0ne decade , most of the years the UPSC toppers are from dalit or OBC category only. That means the rest of the selected candidates including EWS reserved are much inferior to those reserved category toppers. Do you know for centuries together certain community people were denied education in our country and only so called top castes like brahmins etc were given education. Take Tamilnadu during Petiyar time 90% of jobs were in the hands of 3% brahmin population. Why do not you think of socio , economic inequalities. 80% of people in absolute poverty 25 crores today ate from dalits only. 50% of dalits do not have any assets, land,house, bank balance, tools, equipment etc etc. They earn their livelihood from labour in the fields, kilons, construction works, maids, sanitary workers, Ayas in hospitals for a small wages. As long as this wide spread differences  in socio, economic condition and discrimination one kind of reservation or another will continue. Present govt gave more than 2 lack crores tax concession to corporates. Banks / govt gave 80% discount in repayment whicu comes to more than ,8 lacks crores for corporate bank defaulters inder IBC.

Even company and small business make them work as much as they possible. I even bet, many engineers were doing 8-9 hrs job 7 days a week for basic pay, and we are not even talking about pay rise after one year completion and bonds that are made while joining the company. Major problem lies in job culture and corporates, they have blamed the education system so they don't have to pay more, if someone ask why don't you pay more then they say they are not skilled, if employee want to leave and go other countries then they say employee don't have patience we are about increase the pay, even if the person is skilled, they just try to get some sort of defects of employee.

355,2023-08-26T07:38:26Z,@dr.ravishankarpolisetty2820,"I would like to begin by extending my heartfelt congratulations to the exceptional efforts being undertaken by the team at Think School. The remarkable work you are all engaged in is truly commendable, and I am genuinely impressed by your dedication and accomplishments. Please accept my best wishes as you continue down this path of excellence.  Allow me to introduce myself as a cardiac surgeon with a profound commitment to advancing Translational research in the field of Ayurveda. Over the course of more than three decades, I have invested a substantial portion of my life into this pursuit. Despite the passage of time, my passion for this work remains undiminished, and I am resolute in my commitment to its continuation. In fact, my strong affinity for my work prompted me to make the deliberate decision to leave the allure of more favorable opportunities in the Western world and return to India in December 2017 after my 17 years of stint in the western (Canada, USA) world. The research I conducted garnered significant acclaim within the British Parliament, leading to invitations extended to me on two distinct occasions to address the esteemed members within the House of Commons. Moreover, the fact that I was invited to speak not just once but twice at the House of Commons underscores the significance of my findings and insights.   All this was possible because, I stand as the sole individual in the whole wolrd, who successfully modeled the Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas in experimental animals, a feat that has generated a substantial volume of data. This accomplishment also encompassed the development of distinctive markers for each dosha, underscoring the pioneering nature of my work. Furthermore, I have achieved a distinct milestone by showcasing the regeneration potential of vital organs such as the heart, a phenomenon that I am the sole demonstrator of within the field.  Beyond these achievements, my commitment to innovation is evident through the filing of more than 17 patents and about an impressive count of 41 technologies that are deemed patentable. My  track record as an Intergative Physician speaks volumes as we have effectively provided treatment to a substantial count of over 28,000 patients in the advanced stages of their illnesses, achieving favorable outcomes in each case. The success achieved in these treatments is a testament to our expertise and dedication in managing end-stage patients with a high degree of proficiency, By properly aligning our accumulated expertise with the right resources and strategies, India can establish itself as a global leader in addressing end-stage diseases. This entails collaborative efforts among various stakeholders, including healthcare institutions, researchers, policymakers, and industry partners. The journey towards capturing a significant share of the 1.2 trillion-dollar market demands foresight, investment, and a commitment to delivering world-class healthcare solutions.  However, upon my return, I encountered a significant challenge: the Ministry of AYUSH lacks the necessary expertise among its members, resulting in a fundamental misunderstanding of the core principles of research and a dearth of scientific temperament. Regrettably, the competitive environment for mediocrity that characterized the landscape 25 years ago still persists. This culture undermines the appreciation of valuable contributions made by individuals, while simultaneously inflating the self-importance of their own people inside the ministry and govt institutions. Despite my efforts to share the insights garnered from my research data, there appears to be a resistance to implementing this knowledge.  Furthermore, I have observed a distressing lack of scientific temperament even within the community of Ayurvedic doctors. The reluctance to embrace learning and the prevailing attitude of possessing all-encompassing knowledge hinder the growth and evolution of this field. Engaging in meaningful conversations with these professionals proves challenging due to their deeply ingrained preconceptions. The reputation of Prime Minister Modi as a leader with an unwavering commitment to honesty and transparency is a sentiment that resonates strongly among the populace. His personal conduct and statements consistently reflect a dedication to upholding ethical standards and combating corruption. This perception has solidified his position as a figure of integrity in the eyes of many. Nonetheless, the larger administrative framework in which Prime Minister Modi's efforts are channeled is grappling with a persistent challenge: the infiltration of corrupt elements. These individuals, driven by self-interest and a disregard for ethical considerations, undermine the noble goals set by the Prime Minister. Their actions stand in stark contrast to his principles and cast a shadow over the broader system's effectiveness.  In order to fully realize the transformative vision that Prime Minister Modi envisions for the nation, addressing the issue of corruption within the system is of paramount importance. This calls for comprehensive reforms that not only target punitive measures against corrupt individuals but also focus on preventative measures, such as strengthening accountability mechanisms and fostering a culture of transparency.  Beyond these concerns, another disheartening issue arises: a blatant disregard for the rules outlined in the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Even the most basic traffic regulations are flouted, leading to immense stress for individuals navigating the streets. This casual approach to rules and norms creates an environment of chaos and poses risks to the safety and well-being of all road users.  Remaining resolute in my decision, I want to emphasize that my departure from India is not on the horizon. As long as my commitment to transforming my enterprise into a thriving unicorn company remains unfulfilled, I am firmly rooted here. However, my intention is to extend valuable insights to those individuals who might be contemplating a return to India, equipping them with a comprehensive understanding of the prevailing circumstances.  My determination to stay within the Indian landscape is driven by a fervent ambition to elevate my enterprise to the esteemed status of a unicorn. This entails a relentless pursuit of innovation, growth, and excellence, as I strive to contribute to the nation's entrepreneurial ecosystem. My vision aligns closely with India's burgeoning potential, and I am resolute in my belief that my efforts can contribute positively to its economic and technological advancement.  In my endeavor to share insights with potential returnees, my aim is to provide a nuanced perspective on the current state of affairs. I recognize the significance of well-informed decisions, especially in a dynamic and ever-evolving environment like India. By offering accurate and comprehensive information, I intend to empower those considering a return with the knowledge necessary to navigate challenges and seize opportunities effectively.  While my personal journey is intrinsically tied to India's entrepreneurial landscape, I acknowledge the broader context within which decisions are made. Factors ranging from economic trends and regulatory frameworks to technological advancements and socio-political dynamics play a pivotal role in shaping the environment for both startups and established businesses. Thus, sharing insights goes beyond mere advice; it's an act of fostering awareness and preparedness for those intending to contribute to India's growth story.  In essence, my journey in the realm of Ayurvedic Translational research has been both inspiring and challenging. While I remain steadfast in my dedication, the landscape is marred by a lack of understanding, a culture of mediocrity, and a reluctance to adapt. Addressing these issues requires a collective effort to foster a culture of scientific curiosity, respect for contributions, and adherence to societal norms, ultimately propelling the fields of medicine and research towards greater heights. the distinction between Prime Minister Modi's personal integrity and the presence of corruption within the system is essential. While his commitment to honesty remains steadfast, the battle against corruption demands a systemic overhaul to ensure that the lofty ideals he espouses translate into tangible change at all levels of governance.",1,0

The main thing India needs is natural resourses and that can only be possible if our geo political stance is right. We need energy and food big time. Manpower we have. The main reason why US companies like Google and others hire Indians to be CEO's is because they want to target Indian markets for expanding their business as they India to be a huge market with 1.5 billion people and it's always great if they make an Indian the face of their company so that if would help them to pass through regulatory hurdles in India.

It has to do with overpopulation, traffic, horrible weather, low standard of living, excessive pollution, reservation, caste based discrimination, religious fanaticism, zero work-life balance, abusive higher management in corporations, poor work ethics, poor government policies, lack of social security, poor roads and infrastructure, lack of opportunities, corruption, red tape, bureaucracy etc. etc.  When you combine so many reasons together, it is easy to see why anyone with the means to migrate out of India, do so without a second thought. It's very easy to talk about patriotism and all that but everyone knows that we only have one life and we must make the most of it. If other countries can provide a better environment for people to thrive, then most people will obviously choose that over staying in less than favourable conditions and fighting it out.  It's not that our politicians don't know what ails our country but they don't have the desire or the willpower to fix the issues because the status quo serves them just fine. They are all self-serving as are most ordinary people. Nothing has changed even today. The government used to be against anything new and revolutionary back in the old days.

Our education system is highly outdated and requires students to do additional courses to be employable. I graduated from Delhi University with a degree in Math 15 years ago. Even then, they were teaching us outdated programming languages like Fortran 77. I believe even today that course is being taught.  Students are just put into this mindset that they have to do something additional with their regular course to succeed. This is where students learn to slog, put in 10-12 hours of work, and replicate the same even when they join the workforce, which is how the work culture in India is built. This is not a sustainable option. In India, companies think that if you are available 9-5, they have bought those 8 hours of your day. What is different here in the West is that companies understand that between those 8 hours, life can happen as well (kid is sick, partner needs attention). There is a lack of trust that Indian employers have on their employees, which is never good for a relationship.  Anyway, sorry for my rant! Love your content :)",0,0

That has a lot to do with salaries of course and the big things like gender pay gap which I've witnessed personally but has a lot more to do with the tiny issues with our culture where simply leaving work early gets questioned even when the work is done, there is no requirement to stay in office or getting micro managed to stay online with the damn \""green tick\"" for all 8 hours even if there is nothing to do really on a particular day. This can go into too much detail for a comment but honestly, I wasnt someone who left India due to lack of education or lack of opportunity but because of the horrendous (Yes, I said horrendous) work culture of the country. In a country where not only the small businesses but even the MNCs need to learn what work-life balance means. Companies (personal experience) did not even allow their people to stay home long enough during COVID just because they cant trust people to do their jobs and expect them to be available 24*7. Employees in India are expected to work round the clock as they would for their own business but the fact thats forgotten is that not everyone wants to be a business owner else they would have opened up their own practice. Everyone would have been an entrepreneur. People like to have stability, work-life balance, peace of mind and the opportunity to jump opportunities when necessary and I must say the work culture in India is just as big a culprit in addition to the lack of money. Respect is fully missing in our work culture, both in government jobs as well as private. Another big thing I will point out (even though this can open me up to exposure for mean replies), is that women for sure do not get respected for the most part in both these sectors even when they prove to be incredible at their jobs!",0,0

People leave India because they want to live abroad.   There could be multiple reasons ( more income, less crowd, lesser pollution, free society when it comes to sex - dialogue/speech - individual privacy, living abroad is termed as prestigious & flaunt able in India and many more) for it, but I also want to ask that when these \""High Value Individuals\"" have achieved the said purpose ( better education, high paying jobs etc ), how many of them let alone come back to India but even try to set any of their business / implement the learnt technology in the said \""developed & high tech\"" world back in India?  Even the top 1% in those countries which are at the top positions, who understand technology - business & market, who might be atleast millionaires by their early 50s, don't want to come back. Now, by no way I am demeaning their contributions to Indian economy, either by creation of Jobs in those MNCs or donations or foreign remittance, but let's NOT dump everything on our systems & governments because \""People will always follow their own self-interest\"" ( not that it's something bad ).  I think there is one way our institutes & governments can optimize this situation. In the final year of students in IITs, IIMs etc, candidates should be asked to submit (non-mandatory) a paper with their vision & changes in the current technology / business systems that they would like to see / implement in India. That would give them atleast some hint that which candidates are only looking for a better job opportunity & which are more likely to stay & work for India itself.

Above all this a student from being in UR category feel extremely discriminated on basis of our castes (and lol lil of us know that it's actually not just on the basis of caste, atleast that's what our constitution says) and sadly the situation is extremely patehthic for the students who have not been to a tier 1 college. In india if we see there are 2 major areas of work i.e one you can work in a government recruited jobs (ie most of the high profile jobs being recruited by UPSC) and another is going to a private sector jobs. Now, thats another debate whether one is more well paying than other. But the thing Im trying to say is students being umemployeble are either forced to prepare for these govt exams some of which itself takes 2 -3 years just to recruite an individual leaving others with these years of gap and absolute zero skillset and mind that clearing these exams have now become a game of tossing a coin where you are checked on some random knowledge. I have seen students forcibly taking up management courses and going into the loop of preparing for exams like UPSC CSE because even after a post graduation degree from a highly reputed college like Delhi University, students are still umemployeable and opportunities are near zero for the one who genuinely want to pursue any other career than coding in India.  We need to stop glamorizing and romanticizing a particular kind of jobs and actually start investing on education and allied fields. Sadly, these talks just remain with us and with every passing year we see the same budgetary allocation being made with no significant change at all.

Then u have the access to education where quality is reserved only for that 1.5% who mostly have nowhere to work n end up leaving and some forever.,1,0

So they find it much better , though not always convenient, to go live in a country where the mental level matches.

Still, I worked in Govt service for three years and in 2007 decided to give it a shot to move to the West - I succeeded and settled in the USA now. I have mixed feelings about what is right and what is wrong. 1. For the economy part I have to agree - this is a loss for India but I have a question - all the loans students take for higher education in the USA - will it have any positive impact on Indian banks and the economy? 2. I have tried the private practice of radiology - and the way Medicine is practiced in India is not uniform and not everybody's cup of tea- it is very cut-throat and - very few are succeeding. (Not saying this highly expensive American System is right - but profession part I am happy). 3. Can India come up with plans like taxing their Citizens who are making certain amounts of money abroad - Of course - this gets political (I just do my personal work in areas of interest in India though). 4. What is the role of cultures in this entire migration process - I always tell to my kids that Migration for Culture fits my mindset and thought process (I am not justifying the damage it can do to my home nation).

Plutocracy and Kleptocracy is everywhere. Jio (Ambani - Reliance) launched a Laptop and within days India announced restrictions on imports even though the Jio Laptop is full of Chinese components... this is only the most recent one. Remember how the govt kneecapped BSNL to favour Jio? Inflation is rampant. Household debts have increased by 37%. India is ok for the very rich or the very poor... and there is no hope for the actual tax paying middle class. Given the falling birth rates in Europe and far east... the Indian middle class exodus will only increase. Lets not even get into the indirect taxes. So why should any Indian not leave?!,0,0

We can't take a unilateral path anymore, we need to gather skills from different sources so can live and adapt according to conditions.  Also I have seen the difference between the books we read. Most of the time Indian publications just focus on theory which is dry and boring, it's like it's been designed just to gain marks, there are just diagrams but no to very less real pictures of applications. Meanwhile foreign authors have lots of colourful pictures, the writing is so engaging and it's full of arbitrary fun facts and little experiments you can do with minimal help.  So the problem is big.

Only one IIT in the top 150 global rankings. Indian STEM education suffers from our traditional feudal mindset. It is good that our students go abroad for higher studies and get into jobs in the developed world and quickly learn the state of the art. They can become our useful assets when we become ready to use their talents. So stop complaining and prepare a conducive environment for STEM growth back home. Take the case of Sam Pitroda.

Even if you can get a high-paying job at a Google or an Amazon office here, the nasty drive on shitty pothole-ridden roads with amid an atmosphere of pollution and with the unsightly slums encroaching on every corner of most cities, makes for a really horrible experience. Not only that, there's a very rightful feeling among the tax-paying class that they are basically contributing to a system that gives them nothing in return. The publically funded govt hospitals are basically unusable for those with a reasonable income because of how filthy and understaffed most of them are, we see live examples of slums using electricity and water free of cost and then being rehabilitated in Mhada housing which we have to be extremely lucky to ever lay our hands on. All of that is funded on our tax money. On top of that we know very well how business owners, especially rich traders escape paying taxes with impunity. The well-skilled salaried class feels shortchanged by the way this country runs.   Make no mistake, it is a good thing to see poor people be able to use water and electricity, but the haphazard and unethical way in which this is done leaves a bitter taste. The salaried class often feels miserable about the life they are getting here relative to the taxes they are contributing towards the nation. That is the main reason so many want to GTFO of this country. Otherwise, if you look around, there are ample jobs for engineers at startups and MNCs. Sad, and bitter, but true.",0,0

Why do urban Indians leave under capitalism? Why do rural Indians leave? If the Indian identity is constant and primary, and secondary or tertiary identities can be denoted as A, B, C etc, then, why do A Indians leave? Why.do B Indians leave? Why do AB Indians leave?

This has led to corruption that never prevailed before independence   3. In the name of upliftment, we have introduced reservations and divided people which is still a threat even today.   4. IVY and tier1 colleges/ universities have been left scotfree without any monitoring by government  5. For our size of the population Income tax must be rationalised and everyone must pay flat 25% tax and say NO to exemptions or reservations  6. Due to large emphasis on academic scores alone, there are little chances of student enrollment for UG, PG alone  7. This has an adverse impact on the employment/skill development as well.   8.

Investing in R&D with a smaller population is a smaller gross figure compared to the population here. Again, I fully agree that the government needs to spend more on improving the R&D facilities here to bring them up to par.   But I kinda like what the government is doing now to tackle the issue, although this is a more longer term solution. Initiatives like Make in India and the Mudhra loans are ways to increase entrepreneurship which thereby creates jobs. How we can leverage our population and make them into tax paying citizens is by creating opportunities which we didnt have till sometime back like you said.  Once that happens, more people will stay back because of opportunities here. Again, this is more long drawn approach, but I feel this a more sustainable and efficient way of retaining talent in the long run. Love to hear your thoughts on this, or even better, a video on this!   Much love man.",0,0

Don't trust me??? Ask them to pass the GATE exam and make it mandatory for people who want to study abroad. The 90% target is only money. Don't you believe me??? Ask the people who completed their master's abroad what significant impact their course work made in the field they are working on. They will say only dollars, dollars, dollars  It is people's greed that is leading to most of the so called brain drain you are referring to and the more worrying cause of the real brain drain that makes up a significant portion, and the most important one is \""The absence of research focussed institutes and lack of incentivization for people to pursue research in India and peer pressure if they want to pursue it\"" Hope Government takes care of this issue instead of blaming reservation and Anti-National agendas.....",1,0

No IITian is creating jobs in UK or USA they are working for those companies. Today India's Middle class has been created from decades old poor people who were pulled to the mainstream only through the idea of inclusive education. The real issue is job creation which can be addressed only by encouraging start ups and innovation. Why Twitter, facebook, or snapchat was not made here in India by an IITian? What kind of research infrastructure is needed?  To those cribbing about caste based reservations, forget to realise that firstly, our society was based on the most inhuman discrimination, which has led to so much inequality even to this day.... merit was kept in the pockets of certain communities who always felt entitled to this privilege and enjoyed their status throughout history, whether it was during kingly rule, British raj, or today's so-called democratic India.They puposley created this system to their advantage, else how on earth it is possible that only small percentage enjoys huge part of the economy and better education.

You need to understand this serious situation. Students who do not get campus placement and are equally capable with skills just like who got placed are applying for jobs and hardly getting any chance. This is because these institutes train people and give resources to the company and companies first preference goes to such institutes and not the individual who is applying. So those who don't get a campus placement they have to pay for such institutes and get the job. And actually they don't place 100% students also and then students again go to another institute and pay for it. Not everyone can afford to pay for all this.,0,0

Children want to go abroad and parents are healthy, active , want to send them abroad and happily sending. After 10 more years these kids get married, they want their children to be nris by birth and take parents help for deliveries and bringig up of their children for some time. . At this age many parents are healthy and happily doing this job. After 10 more years , both parents or one of them become sick because of old age and they have to lead lonely life in india at 70 years age with nobody's support. This is because in some cases , all children are settling abroad. Some times only single parents are living and leading lonely life in india. They can't adjust abroad environment. In some cases both parents though healthy, they have to lead lonely life and they also don't know when they will become sick because of old age of 70 years.

But I think true culprit is overpopulation, which is neglected and ironically considered beneficial for economy. Like China, India aims to leverage its workforce for economic growth. More people produce more labor which converts into higher GDP which is assumed as economic prosperity. But the model will fail unless we take loans the way China had done, develop highly-skilled workforce and a vast global export market. And as for cutting-edge research, we lack both infrastructure and budget to setup the infrastructure, forcing people to move abroad. Rather than addressing the root cause or evaluating the situation to its fullest, we are addressing the effects, in hope that we somehow pull it off. GDP makes no sense unless the per-capita GDP increases under a low inflation, and inequality shrinks. Though Indian GDP is 5th largest in the world, India is still a developing nation while there are over 80 developed nations in the world.

Being a victim myself of reservation policies in India, I can't imagine this case-study complete without this major factor. @Ganesh mentioned a point where rich people fly abroad and others become liability but what about the struggle of middle class people who are talented, don't get enough opportunity, see partiality in education and employment opportunities at every stage of their life. They struggle everyday in their life and left with no choice other than to leave India for good. While reservation policies are designed to promote social equality and uplift marginalized communities, these policies inadvertently contribute to brain drain in India. Not everyone can join IIT but they are also talented. If they see that lesser talented people are taking admissions into better education institutions, getting government jobs, leading local governments and public sector undertakings; they seek for more stable environments abroad for their careers and lives. :( I have stated the problem but what about the solution? Does that mean we should not aim for social equality and uplifting of marginalized communities? and there should not be any reservations? of course the answer is \""NO\"". But not for those people who do not value the opportunities they are getting through this system. Many of the reserved population are already well above the poverty line. They already reached the social equality that we are talking about. They should be taken out of the \""reserved category\"" gradually but every other politician is overlooking the problem and nobody is searching for solutions.

1236,2023-08-21T08:30:36Z,@priyanksaklani8176,Wait there is another way to look at this: There are 32 million NRIs as of 2022 and they collectively sent 111 billion dollars back to India in 2022 (3468 dollars per person). India's per capita income in 2022 was 2085.12 dollars. This means NRI's are contributing more than an average person does without taking any resources away.  Adding to this NRI's in west are exposed to high technology and new ideas. NRI's then act as a conduict to bring these back to India.  Recently NRI's have started reaching positions of power in West and can help in expanding India's soft power.  India has a surplus of manpower and no good way to utilize it. Instead of loosing the surplus manpower its always better to let them be utillised where there is a demand for manpower. Although I agree with you that we loose on quality but i think we make more than enough in quantity. Dont forget if India keeps this development pace then maybe in 10-15 years highly experienced NRI diaspora will definitely try to return back.(a trend i have alread started seeing),0,1

I just wanted to add that even IITs are providing many study materials for free in online mode. For example, IIT Madras's website has tonnes of courses for free. Moreover, even foreign institutes research data and courses as you said, are available even for Indian students, or perhaps any learner in the world.  One more thing. You talked about Israel and its investment in R&D. I think Israel is now a superpower just because in the early days when the government of Israel would have made investments, the Israeli people did not leave the country(one of the reasons could be because Israel is a Jewish country and Jews were treated very badly in the foreign or maybe the government didn't allow their citizens to migrate to a foreign country; just an assumption). If the people of Israel would have left at that time, Israel would have not gotten to where it is today. Also, Israel has very less population which makes it much easier to invest in its people compared to India where one child is born every two seconds.  Even so, I agree that the education system in India is just rubbish.

1458,2023-08-21T03:09:02Z,@sarveshtd,"In India, the education system is draining our knowledge and parents don't know what their children need. They simply doing what others are doing. If the children are passionate on doing something their parents are their first enemy, parents think that if their children didn't study what would they do in future. This is the main reason they push their children to the schools. All the schools are teaching same syllabus but the parents are thinking that schools should be better than teaching. In the schools early stage of studying childrens are forced to cramming rather than understanding the topics. This makes the habit. So they are not able to understand the topis. After completing the schooling they don't have a prior knowledge of what they want to study or what they want to become. So again the parents are comparing their children to other children how they are studying. So the rate race continues in college too. In India most of the colleges are not focusing on education, they focus more on branding and marketing. When the students are in final year placement they came to know that what are they studied so far is waste of time. They enterprise is looking for skilled students with practical knowledge. So they are understanding that practical knowledge is important so they don't have sufficient practical tools in India so they move abroad for studies. Eventhough some of the students are get placed in some salary packages they are not satisfied with the salary. So this is also the man reason for moving abroad. In India the dirty politics and corruption that makes the India's talent vain. To avoid this they are getting settled in overseas for social peace  .",0,0

1541,2023-08-21T01:41:55Z,@tractortyre4260,"I think the close minded dream of getting placement packages worth crores from IITs is the only reason why India produces so many engineers. Most aspirants start preparing for JEE only to get into an IIT. No one has a dream of going to some Jethalal College of Engineering. And those who are not a part of those \""most aspirants\"" prepare for JEE because they don't know what else to do.  But as he said only a ridiculously less number makes it to IITs, good NITs and other sensible placement giving colleges. So what do the rest do? Instead of leaving the thought of doing engineering as they didn't get selected into the top colleges and going with any other field or \""following their passion\"", they compromise on education quality and still do engineering and settle with colleges where they know they'll neither get education nor any sensible jobs.   Blame goes to the lack of awareness or misinformation of other fields and the Indian tradition and culture as well. Because children in India rely on their parents' money even after finishing school, they feel the obligation to select the field which their parents either directly prefer or which the child thinks they'd prefer. In other cases parents either directly decide their children's career path or indirectly by comparing them only to those students who got successful in engineering or medicine and not any arts or commerce related fields.  I think this presence of a pool of mostly unwilling and passion-less engineers who made compromise and settled with whatever was available to them is the reason why a lot of them are unemployable.

Anyone who can afford it, are leaving, not because they hate India, but because their worth is never given its due recognition. All that matters to the govt and psus are your surname and caste. Your intellect, hard work, dedication mean nothing at all. If other countries recognise it and want to value it, people will be forced to move out due to disillusionment and the fact that people want to take care of their families as well. Despite getting good marks and studying so hard, if it is not recognised, anyone will want to go where they get their due recognition. Indian diaspora contributes heavily to the American economy. They themselves acknowledge it. Nothing will ever be done by any govt to stop reservation. Many come to power using only their surnames with no other merit. Why would they change a system that suits them. They don't care for India. They care only for votes. Young people have the choice to either live in poverty despite having the credentials to earn well, or to move out for the sake of their families. Not surprised people choose the latter. Also the license permit raj made it next to impossible to set up start ups and small industries easily. It was like trying to put several spokes in even before the wheel could turn. Ease of doing business is very high in America. No wonder so many Indians went there. Please don't even talk about Israel in same breath as India. They don't force out their talent on the basis of reservation. Here money isn't driven towards r&d either. It is pushed towards more freebies for minorities and reserved communities.

(Right now high income OBC - Non creamy layer doesn't get any privilege from Central govt across the board and people can fake caste or income at their thahsiladar office - corruption).

Bollywood also played a good role in showing businessman in bad light. They created this narrative that business owners always earn money through cheating. This led to people less appreciative of their work that helps grow India economically.  3. The Indian monopoly law made sure that quality Indian companies never become giants in their respective fields. It also basically kills competition which led to decline in innovation.

On top of that, around 30% of the students at all levels were quota-students (reserved categories excluding BCs) who were already demotivated because of the hard academic demands from the curriculum. A substantial portion of them struggled to get passing grades and weren't able to complete in time. Those who completed in time went to govt. jobs that were unrelated to the education they received, leveraging their quotas. It was a purely messed up situation.",84,5

Here  in India the 2-tier and 3-tier college grads get about 25k(mostly) to 60k  per month but when they get into abroad  on an average they get about 4k-6k dollars on average for this category which means after all spendings(including enjoying some lifestyle changes ) they can can still save 1k-2k dollars per months which is almost 5times salary which they get in hand before their spendings which is very good for their families in India. Here their families economic and social status is increased which is absolutely fine. We cannot only  blame govt and students  because most of the foreign companies and Indian companies utilising Indian youth with cheap salaries for the same work where they could get good salaries in foreign. here i'm only specifically saying about average and below average students from tier2 and tier3 colleges,1,0

1674,2023-08-20T19:23:28Z,@DJ-bo4pz,"1. Most IITians can get a job in India, it's not because of the absence of job in India that IITians leave India, but because of the lack of peace of mind and the mediocre outcomes they get for grinding away their youth. Government expects \""Deshbhakti\"" from a person who championed 1.7 million students (this again is a socialist approach in a capitalist world, you have to incentivise them to stay here). 2. Exclusivity of education: Those people who don't get into IITs and NITs are not lacking in any quality education, they do get into private colleges if their parents can afford it, and later still make their way to western economies. On top of that, except a few IITs and NITs, most have babu-type profs who are at the bottom of their game. Most IITians are excellent not because of what the government provides them, but because of their peer group.  It's the poor and talented applicants who suffer,  because if they don't get into IITs and they can't afford a decent private university then they are subject to a far worse peer group. They stay uneducated and poor  a very lucrative vote bank for any government  it's easier to appease dumb and poor people. This education system ensures that India gets recognized for it's talent by exporting the talented, but at the same the governments have an easy way of winning elections by appeasing whatever uneducated masses remain  a much easy job.   The solution:  1. Privatize all central government owned institutions, the US federal government doesn't own any university, they might be investors in it, but not sole owners. This will dissolve the value that masses give to the IITs, it might backfire as well, because at the moment this system is a marker for talent identification, for a few years it will cause problems to the employers. 2. Abolish reservation at all level of education (this is a socialist mechanism in a capitalist economy) 3. Establish strong rule of law and ensure that the payscale is as per the global standards not relative to the poorest. You need rich and educated people to fund innovation. 4. Incentivize education and instead of stopping people from going out, promote them to go out and get skilled BUT incentivize their return, at the moment there is 20% surcharge on amount > 7LPA, this is just a way to punish the talented, do you really think they would take this positively?  It almost feels like the government is the enemy of these people.  No matter which government comes in India, they are always going to appease to the poor because they are the masses, and it is in the best interest of the government to appease the masses. It is also in the best interest to keep them uneducated, because it's easier to convince a person who can't think deeply. It's basically a Nash equillibrium, you keep them dumb and poor and they can stay in the country, the moment they are rich and talented, time to kick them out, because if the rich and talented formed the masses, effectively all kinds of vote bank politics would fail.  In fact, it is the US immigration policies that are keeping Indian economy afloat, if US just relaxed their visa rules or increased the H1B size for IITians and NITians, it's almost game over for India, I don't wish that but, it's the harsh truth. Every single IITian and NITian friend at the moment will grab a US opportunity right now. The only ones who won't are the ones who have wife and kids in India, if the incentive is enough they too won't stop. It's an incentive game, that the Indian government doesn't care about at the moment.  Just imagine, at the moment US doesn't recognise Indian medical degrees, otherwise what havoc would that cause on Indian healthcare system? In short, India is operating at the mercy of US immigration policy.",1,0

There is no brain drain, c'mon for the sake you do know the population of our country and there is JUGAAD in each and every corner. If you say engineers aren't there in India at all then how we are building so advance space products in ISRO, and aircraft carriers? and advance weaponry... Other logic is, if YouTube is growing in the world by contribution of an Indian CEO, does it not help ThinkSchool grow thanks to courtesy by Internet? Or ApnaCollege grow? Or ecosystem by which digital payments are becoming revolution, technology may be copied but its still in use which helps India ultimately. What do you think if Indian scholars have gotten in India having they not been into US creating languages like Java or Google?  Or do you want to say that people like Kalam who have built Integrated Missile Development Programs or Homi Bhabha whose brainchild makes India a nuclear power all a braindrain? Aren't people creating new startups, surely not innovative but still not bringing jobs or money on table? To all the Indians I want to say never ever think there is brain drain at all, if people are going that's because they get better opportunity which in turn helps society and community and there is always a bunch of more people who can replace them and get better going. Taxation is an issue but it need other more reforms instead of more workforce from same field. There is never any lack of talent in India, by February in Covid there was no PPE manufacturing unit, by June there were 1100 startups for same, and for the ventilators as well... Never ever think new people won't be able to replace the outgoing people, never ever, you make 5 crore brightest people out of country, it still will flourish. We have so much population that eventually people will figure out a way to earn living even if he/she is devoid of engineering colleges or no funds to go abroad.

I think taxes are the reasons why many companies that were previously established in India, is right now shifting bases (mainly Dubai). The tax systems are so complex and high in India, that highly talented people would choose to go to do business in a country where the tax laws are friendly. So, the growth in private sector is slow. More complex the tax systems are, less willing the people would be to pay taxes. So, the government will not get their share.",0,0

Obviously, I didn't qualify for the JEE and got 32k rank in the State Engineering Entrance Exam. Still with proper data analysis and precise option filling, got a Merit seat for IT Engineering in a University Campus.   I learnt what a Carpenter to Civil Engineer would do in the first year but didn't learn what an IT Engineer would do. Which made me realise that the syllabus is too old for the time. Hence I decided to come out of the syllabus to study myself from problems and try to build solutions. I did my college projects without external help other than some online contents.   But I ended up with backlogs in a few semesters which removed me from eligibility at most tech firm's freshers opportunities.   Despite the backlogs I applied for a special project centric PG by CIHL called MSIT. I did my aptitude test and thanks to the CAT coaching I took, I got into JNTUH. Successfully completed 1st year as batch topper. But ended up losing admission due to B.Tech backlogs that got dragged due to COVID lock down.  During the PG course, I got the opportunity to work on a startup project operated by IIIT-H faculties. I did my best and made a reputation towards the end of the project.  The contacts made during the project helped me to secure a fresh admission at IIIT-H for MSIT. I just accepted my degree last month from campus on AI ML specialization with a good CGPA.  But the placement cell of the campus failed in bringing opportunity that values my talent. The startups visited the campus, looked up for Algorithms and Data Structure Nerds. Unfortunately I wasn't one and hence didn't get any initial drives. The placement cell had compelled me to sit for BPO hiring. They just want everyone to secure some placements to keep a 100% placement tag. So I moved on to Qatar to my father for a better opportunity.  Yesterday my first start-up project as CTO failed. Journey continues....  Once, you might hear my story.   My name is Ameen, Identified at ameenclick",0,0

They would not invest in R&D very much.  All they would do is to buy off the shelf technologies from abroad and manufacture under licence only exploiting cheap labour force which is available in abundance in India. They still have the age old habits of their ancestors and that is to be risk averse.    Secondly, our education system only produces Babu scientists and babu engineers. How many of these scientists and engineers are ready to make their hands dirty?  Oh no, that is beneath their dignity.

So, I feel the first and foremost things which should be done are: 1) Make a team in the government who give out the accreditation to courses also make necessary changes required in the industry. 2) Create the job market (which is now hopefully being created) for the skilled persons out there.  3) A middle ground between the socialist and capitalist approach which gives the fair playing ground of everyone.  Lastly I want to mention, just being a critic doesn't give me the right to give suggestions but the whole approach to how the government sector works with this \""job security\"" thing should change.

And the worst part is the people who think iq is constant and think they won't be able to increase a student iq if they don't understand what they are saying and use it as an excuse and focus on some handfull children , Alfred Binet created iq test to see how many student needed attention and he said \""Education can improve IQ\"" (i mean they could have learned some better method of teaching students from western countries but they only learn excuses)  It's better to become an US or UK citizen as this problem of education will stay in India and would not come to an end till three to four generation All the hardwork in education just to go to a collage which asks you to write a program in 29.7 x 21 cm copy.",0,0

In 2007, when I was my Bachelor's final year and working in Europe on academic internship, a US professor who was collaborating on the project offered me a fully funded master's. I applied for him as advisor, since it was all free education I went to US in 2008 for my master's. Completed my master's in US, got married in 2012 and had twins in 2014. In 2019, we decided to move back to India to be closer to our parents.  There is complete chaos in the system. People do not respect each other, push through queues (if there is a queue). A scooter driver was talking on phone, hit my kid and was cussing my kid instead and ran away. Even I have been harassed myself many times in banks. I had more than 50+ lacs in that bank and had to threaten them I will take everything out, then they immediately started to work. People at work or anywhere have no respect for time, no work ethics, our family life was in jeopardy and we started to have fights, our kids health was detoriating due to pollution.  Ultimately, in 2022 we decided to move back and left India again.",1,0
2066,2023-08-20T16:14:38Z,@Mrjain8555,I am from 97 percent of  engineers no doubt about my capacity and capabilities but I am from general category. In 2005 I appeared for AIEEE and got 96 mark but the very next student with 47 mark got into NIT trichy all because he was an OBC candidate  .  Luckily I got into Jain college (being in the same religious community) and completed my engineering. So I don't think the government has done anything for my education rather come with katora and asked for taxes. After college in 2009 it was difficult to land a job just because USA economy was blown out of recession. Father funded 25k for a NIIT coaching  (thankful for him) which helped me with my first 8k job. Until 2016 I was Ernst-whilst tax payer taking 20k each month from my pocket to government katora. Now it was high time to become an NRI and just give peanuts to the government taxes.. happy to settle and pay taxes aboard.,101,26

The reservation in India is 50 percent + 10 for EWS . I in no way say that quota is needed to lift the socially backward but the way politicians in India are using caste based reservation to increase their voter base and I am afraid they will try to increase the quota percentage. At present the cut off for a govt medical College in my state is 620 out of 720 which is above 85 percent and is starting to become ridiculous and the avg private  colleges charge nearly 1cr which is unaffordable for the majority of India.

2135,2023-08-20T15:46:28Z,@DesirousSam,"Reason for brain drain is completely flawed. Main reason are ... Social status - being in foreign increases social respect of family Currency conversion rate - even with small saving foreign when sent back to India (remittance), it becomes more. Pay/utilisation of skill - Highly skill move out due to higher pay for their skill, which companies in India don't provide. Also, hardly high skill work is done in India, what we mostly do is only cheap labour for foreign customers. Human index - India is crowded, social services are slow, poor and corrupted, infrastructure is not good, basically foreign countries provide better living conditions.  Now, points to counter some other statements. 1. Even if HL education is provided to more people, they and more become highly skilled, so more people are eligible to move out. 2. India has open learning infrastructure from NPTEL, so if students are not utilising it can't blame system. 3. More people are unemployable bcoz we study for degree not knowledge, once knowledge becomes criteria for job selection problem might solve. 4. This video is just trying to be politically correct and dismissive of Reservation, which one of primary reason rich/middle class Indian moving out of India and study in foreign colleges bcoz students less deserving get into college just bcoz hundred years back their forefathers were abused. Reservation creates new age  resentment among people and modern day reverse discrimination. E g. Why a highly educated and successful family needs reserved seat.",0,0

2161,2023-08-20T15:38:30Z,@elsonicsanto,"Dear Mr. Prasad,   You are a great guy doing incisive studies. But let me tell you that  brilliance in India is subjected to absolute frustration. Creating Engineering colleges with fine infrastructure and good branding is  not of much use to  the graduating students. On the other hand in the USA many of the high brand Universities  do not only go for jobs but start small businesses that get fantastic financial and other support to take risks and grow. The important  jobs mostly go to immigrants many of them are Indian engineering graduates. The vibrant atmosphere in the USA creates more and more wealth. If any competent engineer stays back in India to build India in the belief that they can do it, the  many obstacles they face will  leave them  disappointed & disgruntled.  Please look at the following analysis that will indicate some aspects that lead to this situation.  The first thing is that Govt. and bureaucrats must be able to really understand who produces the real wealth of the country as reflected in GDP.  It is not paper shufflers like Govt. employees & bureaucrats or money shufflers like banks, financial institutions, stock traders or paper money printing presses in Govt control. It is Medium & Small business Enterprises & Small Farmers who create about 70% of India's wealth. The large companies contribute only about 15% while the rest is indirectly contributed by Govt employees, paper shufflers and the Armed forces. The latter deserve to be supported as they offer their lives for the Nation's safety and well-being.   What happens to the direct & indirect taxes collected from the majority? Most of it goes to pay the salaries and perks of the service providers, who form the balance 15% of which about half goes to the armed forces. Payment to the Armed forces is well deserved but the other half often take a greater share, simply because they control the Govt machinery. The true producers of wealth don't get a fair share of the wealth that they produce and therefore emigrate to more proactive countries. This is a great liss yo India in real terms.  Instead of building  showpiece buildings and infrastructure with low cost  development funds, it is the MSMEs that need the low cost funds with easy access.     Author ChittaRanjan Bhatt,",0,0

Exploring their impact on businesses, audits, and financial reporting could provide valuable insights to your viewers.  Additionally, a detailed analysis of investment bankers would also be highly informative. You could cover their historical evolution, the diverse roles they play in financial markets, and their contributions to shaping the economic landscape. Understanding their functions in mergers, acquisitions, and capital raising activities would be particularly interesting.

If you don't the question is where can i go to get wealth to change my family and generation fortune. That is the US and Europe. That is it, it is a simple as that.  India at the core can't match what the US and Europe have to offer, and unfortunately it may not ever able to due to the systematic corruption, lack of opportunities, a severe lack of infrastructure, miss management of government funding, and a caste system that is still prevalent (unfortunately).   These are fundamental problems, and a very VERY challenging ones. India needs to focus on the basics. Water, power, trash, road infrastructure that makes sense, a school system that is equal....and then focus on universities.  Just some sobering statistics: 600 Million indians live on less than $3.10/day. Where a medium living requires $535 to $1749.
